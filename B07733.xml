            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Notwithstanding, sith this sacred do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which we sustaine is such, that it needeth not to shunne any sort of triall, my whole endeuour shall therfore be, to set no fairer glosse vpon this cause, then the very nakednes of truth it selfe shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; so that following euen the text of Christ him selfe, the sincere sence of his wordes and speeches, and that by the light of most vpright iudgments, by the direct pathe and rule of reason, by the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all times and ages, by the opinions of the most learned and grauest diuines that euer were, who nether affected flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie to please, nor fawning to deceiue,

            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> But here such as of long custome haue harboured sinne within their soule, with the repining Iewes, will make this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, saying. How can man forgiue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or claime vnto him a prerogatiue which is due to God? wherto we answer, that all the holy Sacraments of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion (especcially those which were more requisit and necessary for mans saluation) were not only plainly manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the holie scripture, but also were shadowed in the law of nature, figured and specified in the law of Moises, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and fulfilled in the law of grace; wherupon the people of the Iewes did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly beleeue, that their sacrifices and oblations were litle auaileable, except therunto were adioyned, penance, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and confession of their sinnes. If
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:181278:4"/> then, Confession were so necessary, and so dulie exacted by God him selfe in those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, euen before the diuulging of the gospell, as that therby transgressors were attoned and reconciled to God, what shal we thinke thereof in the law of grace, where it was not only confirmed, but with far more ample power, instituted &amp; commanded?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Againe, if these persons would but consider the wordes of Christ (Iohn 5.22.) where he telleth the Iewes, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudgeth not any man, but that all iudgment is giuen to the Sonne, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, regard the wordes of Christ (Iohn 20.) where he telleth his Apostles, that as his Father sent him, so he sendeth them, and so surrendring ouer (as it were) his authoritie, he breathed into them the holy Ghost, it may easily appeare, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deny the Apostles, and their successors the priestes of Gods church, to haue right or power to remit sinnes, doe with all deny consequently, that Christ as man, hath authoritie to doe the same. To make this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:181278:5"/> point the more plaine, was not S. Paul when he was called by Christ, sent to Ananias a man, to receiue as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, as the Sacraments of Gods church, for his incorporatiō with the faith full, and remission of his sinnes? Was not Cornelius, bid to goe to Peter a man, for the ministry of his reconciliation, though his prayers had bene heard before, and an Angell also sent vnto him? Where we see euidently although God might haue cured him extraordinarily, yet he would pūctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserue his prefixed, determined, and ordinarie course, of working, attoning, and reconcyling by man.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> Now therfore, as we vnderstand by diuine reuelation, that God the Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>th giuen all iudgment to his Sonne, and that by him we must haue remission of all our sinnes, so that now whosoeuer should presume to pray to God alone, ommitting his only Sonne our B. Sauiour, shall not obtaine pardon, but breake the holy prcept of his wil, and the order which he hath appointed in his church: euen so, since
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:181278:5"/> the time that our Sauiour hath giuen to his Apostles and their successors, full po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to forgiue sinnes, whosoeuer now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth remission of sinnes by Christ only, and not by Christs ordonance and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is by Christs priests and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of his church, in whom as S. Paul saith (2. Cor. 5.) he hath put the word of reconliation, shall no more obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his sinnes, by contemptuously reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the priestly function, and appealing only to Iesus Christ, then with the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes or Iewes, to seeke only to God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mediation of Iesus Christ, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the incarnation of our Lord and Sauiour</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> But we shall yet much better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the great necessitie of this holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, if we reuiew former factes, and the ancient ages of the Catholique church (which in respect of this new fangled age, subiect to all sort of disorder and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish sensuallitie, might well be called, a golden age) where we may clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould, the vse &amp; practise of Confession,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:181278:6"/> yea the ineffable benefit thereof, which in sundrie kindes hath so accorded all sortes of discordes, that in what contrie soeuer it hath bene abandoned, they haue forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fallen into most miserable estate in matter of religion, yea most men amongst them haue become lesse virtuous then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, women lesse chast, children lesse obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and seruants lesse trustie: so that by this meanes, wickednes hath seemed euen to be full ripe, yea and honestie cleane exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the world.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8.</hi> Hence it proceeded (and marke it well deare Christian I hartily pray thee) that vnder Charles the fift, the Lutherans hauing shaken off this yoke of holie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and by this meanes, made earth a hell, and men diuells, the legates of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberge, seeing how needfull this bit was to be put into their wanton and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly iawes, besought his imperiall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. <hi>Vt iterum Confessionem impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio iure restituret.</hi> To set vp againe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them Confession, by virtu of his imperiall power. A ridiculous iest, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:181278:6"/> what before they could not brooke, being commanded by the word of God, they would now for sooth entertaine being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by man. Yea our owne contrie of England, vntill now of late, euer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this holie Sacrament. For albeit that in king Henrie the eight his time, the coale of disunion from the sea Apostolique was enkindled, and the fire of the kinges choller eagrely flaming, yet neuer suffered he the Sacrament of Penāce &amp; Confession, to loose his former reputation, nor yet the contrary faith once to harbour in his breast, but obserued it inuiolablie euen to his dying day.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9.</hi> Now then (deare Christian) let not this true, ancient, and Catholique faith concerning Confession, be blotted or spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with partiallities, notwithstanding, that our aduersaries haue inuēted a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deuises to fill mens eares with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thereof, and most maliciously spread abroadidle tales, false rumors, many taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and merry iestes to please the humor of the common people, especially the nicer sort,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:181278:7"/> who will admit of no gospellll, but where pleasure is mentioned in euery page: for certaine it is, that these late reformers haue forged a million of slanders against this Sacrament, and fashioned the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of mens mindes in such sort, as that they haue made euery thinge sound to the vtter disgrace therof as far as they could; as, that the papists are nothing but clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of ignorance, their doctrine nothing but dust and cobwebbes of a corrupted age, their deuotions but grosse idolatrie, men seared with the badge of Antechrist, the horned beast, Masse-mongers, the whore of Babilon, the scarlet strumpet, and finally, that confessions, are flat hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisies and dissimulations. But alas they haue spent a great deale of their lamp-oile and labour in vaine, especially seeing at this day many of the milder and more iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious sort of Protestants, (as in many other pointes controuersed betwixt vs and them, so in this also of auricular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) seeme now to be more fauourable then formerly they haue been; drawen on

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the better proofe of this truth and veritie, I thinke it not amisse, to distinguish into parts, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers states of mans being after his creation: to shew hereby by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that it was the will and pleasure of our Lord, to ordaine an effectuall instrument of reconciliation for vs in his Church, that is to say, a remedy far sharper for man after his ruinous downfall after Baptisme, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit, by sorrow, shame, and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Confession of such actuall sinnes as he shall haue committed, after the cleasing of his originall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To compare therfore state, with state, we must consider, that as before man was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generat by the sacrament of Baptisme, and made a member of Iesus Christ, there were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:181278:9"/> two seuerall estates, the one different from the other; The first, the state of his Creation, wherin he was both made and placed in a path and high way of perfection, his soule proceeding from God his maker, pure, vns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potted and virgin like, without any blemish or soile of sinne. The second, a state of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, of thraldome and vassalage, to which man, by the transgression of Adam, was wholy subiect, and lay groning vnder the waight and burthen of sinne: so in like maner after Baptisme, man being reconciled to God, by the sheding of the blood of Iesus Christ, we may plainly discerne two different estates, far vnequall the one to the other. The first, after our regeneration and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from originall sinne by the sacrament of Baptisme, a state of perfection, holines and sanctitie, yea a state, answerable to the former state of our creation. The second, a state of relapse or falling againe, thorough our owne wilfullnes, into actuall sinne.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This premised, euery well aduised Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may with due regard consider, that as well the first fall of man from the state of creation, as his second fall after his Baptisme and regeneration, was an enthraling of him in the bandes of the diuell, and a meanes to subiect him to the ordinarie course and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous seueritie of the diuine iustice, yea a bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to the bond and paine of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:181278:10"/> punishment. Hence is to be gathered, respecting the dignitie of that state to which man after his transgression is exalted, and with a far greater ransom purchased and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, if he contemptuously neglect the same, that he is far more culpable, and more to be punished, as a most rebellious creature and contemner, of the gratious loue and kindnes of his Creator. For if we doe but consider the difficultie and difference, how much more laboriously and painfully, God did reforme the ould, then forme the new, that is, compare our Creation, with our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, we shall plainly see, that in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, God said but the word, and it was done: but in redeeming words became also deedes: the one he performed with ease and pleasure, the other not without intollerable paine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. These thinges well weighed and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it may euidently appeare, that the breache of the latter, far exceeded by many degrees the breach of the former. For besides the sinne of ingratitude, the breach of the second, is done with a full aduised will and resolution: wheras the first, was by an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary succession. Whence it followeth, that euery man falling into sinne, after his second bond by Baptisme, doth not only by synning offend his Lord and Creator, but moreouer his Lord and Redeemer; He likewise offends the whole, societie of Christians, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:181278:10"/> of Saints, and the vnited members of Christs Church, into which brother-hood he was admitted by holy Baptisme: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently as the bond is extended, so the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is likewise doubled. It may rightly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be concluded, that the delict and offence after Baptisme, far surpasseth, and therfore is to be punished in a far higher degree ouer and aboue the penalties which are due to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, before they be ingraffed and made members of Christ: and so the attonment of the one, to be far different from the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement of the other, by the seueritie, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes and rigor of iustice: yet thorough the application of the merits, death, and passion of our Sauiour Christ, to be fully communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, to such as truly participat the holie misteries and Sacraments, ordained as mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of reconciliation in his Church.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we seriously consider, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wisdome of almightie God, the rigor of his iustice, the bowells of his mercie, and withall the iust proportionating the cure and medecine, to the languishing disease and ruinous fall of our first parent, and how, and after what orderly sort he restored him again after his fall, we may easilie gather that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth the selfe same wisdome, iustice and mercie of almightie God, to ordaine a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent medecin and salue, for such as with more aduised will, doe after Baptisme most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously transgres his holie commandements, and vngratefully contemne that first grace, which they had receiued of so mercifull a Sauiour.</p>
            <p>First therfore, as in our fall caused by Adam, we did sinne in another: so the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God would, repaire vs againe by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: to wit, by Christ. 2. As the sinne of man in our first parents, was first conceiued in the minde of Eue; without the work of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: so the redeemer of this sinne, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the wombe of a woman, without the helpe of her husband. 3. As the first Adam was made of the earth, a pure virgin: so the second Adam was borne of Marie, a pure virgin. 4. As by the disobedience of the first
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:181278:11"/> Adam, death proceeded from a tree of life to his damnation: so by the obedience of the second Adam, life proceeded from a dead tree, to our redemption. 5. As the bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell perswading the first Eue, hatched the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat birth of sinne: so the good Angell saluting the second Eue, she conceiued the author of grace, who did ransom sinne. In all which misteries of our redemption, we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie see, how God proportioned the plaistre, iust according to the nature of the disease.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The like proceeding hath our Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the holie Sacraments of his Church. Hence it is, that in the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, is ordayned, an externall dipping or fall into the water, liuelie representing our fall in Adam. An outward washing, liuely, representing our inward cleansing. The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall father and mothers consent, with their actuall beleife, is fully auayleable with the holy Sacrament, to the childes saluation that is baptised: as our consent and will in our first parents, was forceible to breake the commandment of God, both to his, and our damnation: and the like proportion it hath in many other points, which here for breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sake I doe omit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence it is, that we discerne the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence and similitude of water, and the outward washing, with the cleāsing, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inward sanctifying of the soule.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:181278:12"/> Which sacramentall water, by virtu of the death and passion of Iesus Christ, geueth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire testimony of the influence of Gods grace, from whence, as from an ocean of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, our whole blisse and happines is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, man being now made Christs by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and a true member of the same Christ. Hence it is, that in holie Baptisme, there is a full and ample remission, and generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all punishment, as well of temporall, as of eternall, without any further obliga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion or bond, to doe satisfactorie or penall workes; For being by Baptisme wholie vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Iesus Christ, planted and ingraffed in that true vine, and made a member of Christ, the whole benefit of his passion is applied vnto vs, euen as if euery sinner had suffered in his owne person, the head yelding all grace and influence, to the rest of the vnited members.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus much then being well, aduisedlie, and maturely considered, that the mercie and iustice of almightie God, would repaire man after his first fall by such waight and measure as hath been set downe, and that (by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his merits) smale and sleight should the penalties be that man should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and sustaine, so that with the elementall water of the holie Sacrament, all staine and soile of sinne should be wiped and washed cleane away; And sith that now there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:181278:12"/> another relapse, and a second fall, the malice thereof much more grieuous then the first, a transgression far more enormous then the former, after a most contemptuous and rebellious maner, and against the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of almightie God, and sacred humanitie of our Sauiour Iesus, I say, man thus relapsed after Baptisme, voluntarilie abandoning his Redeemer, can not without a new reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, enioy the benefit of Christs death and passion, or participat of his gratious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, thus separated and disioyned by the breach of sinne; For hauing made as it were, a diuorce and diuision with Christ, and cut himselfe off from the true vine, wherof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was a member, (without the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of diuine fauors) he rests as a rotten and dead branche, fit only for fuell for hell fyre: no surely, no such withered, blasted and dead member, can draw any life or sustenance frō the roote, nor yet enioy the fruits of Christs death and passion, whose merits are no longer communicated vnto any, then they remayne vnited to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let it be granted, that the death and passion of Iesus Christ, is a price sufficient to ransom and redeeme a thousand worlds, yet is it beseeming the iustice of God, that now in delinquents and transgressors, where the crimes are personall, and the reuoult of euery sinner, is not thorough his parents, but his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:181278:13"/> owne default, they should be made partakers againe of the merits of Christ, by their owne personall cooperation, reconciling them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues before reuolted from him, and taking vp their owne Crosse, haue part in the burthen with Christ, and groane with Cyreneus vnder the heauie waight thereof, to the cancelling, extinguishing, and full satisfying for their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For seeing that the waight of sinne lies now vpon the sinners owne back, and that he can nether father, nor mother his sinne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any other, but vpon him selfe, he must therfore curb and crucify his rebellious mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and vndergoe some penalties and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, answerable in some sort, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionat by iustice, vnto his offences and delicts</p>
            <p n="6">6. Moreouer, it is impossible now, for such as haue fallen from Christ, abandoning his grace and contemptuously breaking his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, to haue againe that first great and ample grace applied vnto them, that is, it is impossible to be Baptised againe, &amp; so to be regenerated a new by a new death, buriall and resurrection of Christ, in so easie and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a maner, and with such full remission of all sinnes, as that first Sacrament of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation with Christ by Baptisme, did most aboundantly afford and yeld vnto vs. Nether can a bare beleefe, and a slight, simple or superficiall memorie of Baptisme, be auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable therunto, for so the course and order of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:181278:13"/> iustice should not be obserued, but peruerted; and greater sinnes should be remitted with more facilitie, then those which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before baptisme. It followeth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that for as much as man hath bene illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and endued by God with heauenly graces, and made partaker of the death, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and merits of Iesus Christ, and of Gods most gratious spirit, now by sining, hauing crucified to him selfe the Sonne of God agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and made him a mocquerie, it seemeth, I say, most consonant to reason, that there should be a more painfull medecin, for the sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Sauiour) to participat of his gratious fauors, to the a new quicking and viuification of his soule. For as after the fall of mankind being created, although he was wholy sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God his Creator, there yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perpetually a similitude of his creation, a naturall likenes, and an indelible image of his Lord and maker, to wit, his free-will (though much weakened and defaced) by which he might arise againe (although not by his proper force and only power) to the similitude and likenes of his former creation, and to the liuelie image of his Creator: so conformably in the second fall of man after Baptisme, albeit he hath made hauock and ruine of his soule, yet there stil remaines ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an indelible marke of Christ his redeemer, a signe or caracter imprinted therin by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this Sacrament, seruing as a token, paune, and pledge, of former receiued graces, and for a foundation wherupon man may againe, lay a new ground worke, and so a

            <p n="2">2. But one thinge is here to be vnderstood by the way, that as man being asisted by grace, may rise againe, so none can haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and forgiuenes of their sinnes, out of the store-house and treasurie of Christs death, nor yet participat of his loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, who doe not tast of his paines and passion: whence it followeth, that to enioy the fruit of his bitter death, wherof we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued our selues thorough our separation from him by meanes of sinne, we must as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely members, be vnited againe vnto our head. For as the naturall life, consisteth in the vnion of the body with the soule: so doth the spiritualll life, in the vnion of the soule with almightie God.

            <p n="3">3 Now then, if the loue of creatures aboue God the Creator, hath bene, and is oft times so forcible and violent in the pursuit of them, is it not consonant to all reason that the loue of God, once entred into the hart, should cause therin as great and forcible dislike of sinne, and loue of him? especially, sith it is not possible, that man should perfectly vnite him selfe againe by loue to God, but with a true hatred and detestation of the euill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly affected.

For as much therfore, as our Sauiour Christ hath suffered innocently for our offences, and that we were the cause of his bitter passion, we ought in like maner to resemble our head in this his sufferance, both in testimonie of our gratitude, loue and conformitie vnto him, as obedient members mortified with Christ our tormented head, as also of our hatred to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and of the zeale and feruor which we beare to christian iustice. Againe, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his owne wordes in the gospell of Luke 9.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:181278:18"/> crime and deadly sinne in an appointed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, to censure, correct, chastice and duly punish it, it remaineth to seeke out what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is most fit, to be this iudge and vmpire, in this high tribunall and seate of iudgment. Where first is to be considered, that Iesus Christ, God and man, being the partie offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and one of them against whom the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and iniurie is committed, will not now sit in iudgment seate against the guiltie, and as both partie and plantife, sue his plea to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and punish him, but hath errected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother court, to determine this cause for the present.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And although that God the Father, hath imparted in this case, all power and iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto his Sonne: and that God the Sonne hath surrendred ouer the selfe same right vnto others, refusing as it were for a time, to be as iudges and executioners ouer such notorious and rebellious transgressors, yet haue they not resigned or giuen this commission ether to Angells or Archangells, for that as they are most pure, vnspotted, and virgin-like crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of our Lord, so if they should heare the confession of our sinnes and filthie enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (being perhaps so many rank breathed sinners) seeing vs without all sweet incense to cast vpon their fire, might giue such a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet vnto their chast eares, that when they should come to cut the thrid betwixt iustice
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:181278:18"/> and mercie, they would vse rather a sharp ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, then a gentle rod, and in hatred of the tares, pluck vp by the rootes an expected crop of corne: for which respect, these most pure and superior powers, would not haue bene meete iudges, in this tribunall and seate of iustice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Being therfore that he would not sit him selfe in iudgment, nor yet resigne this office to Angells, and yet seeing some one was necessary to supply his place for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, he appointed man for his vice-gerent, to exact due satisfaction of any crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against him, and so to reconcile eache sinner to him. Hence it is, that these wordes are so vsually found in holie scripture, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie, albeit that all iudgment is giuen vnto the Sonne (Iohn 5.) yet as his Father sent him, so he sendes his Apostles (Iohn 20.) to wit, with ample power &amp; iurisdiction to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dō sinne. Hēce it is, that S.

            <p n="4">4, For this cause (I say) this mercifull iudge and compassionat Sauior of our soules, out of his meere pittie, hath deligated this power and office vnto man, and that for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie iust reasons. First, for that they are all swathed in Adams bandes, and all of them cast in the selfe same mould, all halting of one disease, all as well one as another, standing in neede of Gods asisting grace, so that euery one may set his tune to his neighbours key, and read in his fellowes fore-head, his owne fault pittie and compassion will therfore take best effect, where one shall perceiue his owne sore to bleed in his neighbours wound. Therfore his will is; <hi>Ite, ostendite vos sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotibus.</hi> Goe and shew your selues vnto the priests.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Secondly, he giues this prerogatiue vnto man, that as euery sinner is posessed with the spirit of pride (only honoring with incense at his altar, the idoll of his owne will) selfe loue rebelling, and mustering it selfe against his Lord and maker: to curb therfore this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kred stomack, and stisnecked obstinacie of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:181278:19"/> this delinquent, he sends him to man, dust of his owne house, to open his sinne to man: that as sinne was begotten without shame, and continued with impudencie, so againe it should be confounded with shame, and ouer-faced with blushing. <hi>Ite, ostendite vos sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotibus.</hi> Goe, shew your selues vnto the priests.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thirdly, he sends the sinner to man, for as much as it is so hard a matter to bring inward shame, to outward confession, that where sinne and malice doth cause most sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me vnto a man of confessing to man, this might at lest somwhat withdraw him from committing or falling into sinne. For many for shame doe cease from sining, when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in their will, there is litle purpose of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending. <hi>te, ostendit: vos sacer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>otibus.</hi> Goe, shew your selues vnto the priests.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Fourthlie, he sends vs to man, that where as sinners haue taken delight in sining, they should be punished by a contrary course in their amending: that is to say, as they haue bene contrarie to the will of God, so will he haue them healed and recured againe cleane contrary to their owne will, by opening that first, which coueteth to lie hid most, and to make another acquainted and witnes of that, wherof he first intended to haue no lest eye-sight or witnes in the world. <hi>Ite, ostendite vos sacerdotibus.</hi> Goe, shew your selues vnto
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:181278:20"/> the priests.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Fiftly, he send vs to man, that as sinne deuides vs farthest from God (for the farthest disioyned place from God appointed for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is the center of the earth, and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and distant from heauen) so man, who is in the midle betwixt both, should haue power, ether to censure vs to heauen. or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuocably to send vs to hell. <hi>Ite, ostendite vos sacerdotibus.</hi> Goe, shew your selues vnto the priests.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Lastly, he sends vs to man, that for as much as our offences, are most commonly against our euen Christian, it should be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in brotherly neighbourhood, and a man to make attonment betwixt brother and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Ite, ostendite vos sacerdotibus.</hi> Goe, shew your selues vnto the priests.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And because there are few men, but that will somtimes straine curtesie with their owne conscience, and set their short cloth vpon the largest tainters, if euery man indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, should be iudge, ether in his owne, or in anothers cause, after his runing into most violent and exorbitant courses, he would perhaps be too too partiall and kind-harted, selfe-loue alwaies dwelling with him vnder one roofe) to enter the furnace of refyning his owne flesh, with bitter penance and satisfaction (God, as the scripture saith, exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of eache to the vtmost farthing.) For
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:181278:20"/> this respect, Christ hath not put the sword into euery ones hand indifferently, nor made euery one iudge and executioner of his owne cause, but in the building and fabrique of his Church, he hath ordained pastors, prelates, and spirituall fathers, whom he hath substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted here on earth, to reconcile vs to him in heauen: yea such who deale with vs in so milde a maner, that if we should weigh in a ballance our ould offences, with the new pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments imposed for them, we shall finde our enioyned penances by his priests, far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrior to the waight of our wicked deedes, and seemeing rather to be touched with a milde iustice, then to torture vs on the tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of seuere correction.</p>
            <p n="11">11. To conclude, as in the workes of the perfect regeneration of man, God and Man were combined together to redeeme man: so againe in the act of reconciliation of man, God would, that God and man should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to reconcile man; And though it were not in that straight and hipostaticall vnion, yet in such sort hath God imparted his spirit vnto man, and so far forth, that our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue dared to deifie them, and to affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that they are made partakers of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to worke and effect Gods work, a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied order, and as it were halfe Gods, and not altogether meere men: yet not respecting their person, but their sacred order and their holy

Nor shall wee see, that inward sinne, loues to come to outward shew, to purchase any sort of shame.

For it is not for ghostly fathers, in matters of conscience, to shoote arrowes idlely or at randome, to iudge causes by twylight, or to solue questions in the darke. Besides, if this generallitie were sufficient for confession, there should be but one maner of binding and losing of all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

S. Tho. 1. 2. q. 87. art. 6. &amp; 3. &amp; 3. part. quest, 86. art. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wherfore, the way to repaire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce penitent sinners vnto the order of diuine iustice (where their contrition is so imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) is, to suffer afterwards some temporall paines, afflictions, chasticements, and curbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the flesh, wherby they may as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, and by virtu of his superaboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant satisfaction and painfull passion vpon the Crosse, satisfie the wrath of God, after a sort, and in their degree. And because that the keyes of heauen, were not only giuen vnto priests to loose, but withall to binde, not to remit sinnes only, but also to re aine, being iudiciall actes, and by the wordes of Christ (whatsoeuer you shall binde Mat. 16.) all kinde of discipline and punishment of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, ether spirituall (which directly is here ment) or else corporall (so far as it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the execution of the spiritua charge)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:181278:28"/> is here comprised, therfore in this court and seate of iudgment, where first the Apostles, and after their successors, were appointeed iudges, priests may, yea and ought, as they absolue delinquents from their sinnes, so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise to enioyne them satisfactorie workes for their penance: that as by their absolution, they remit the guilt of sinne, and the eternall punishment therto belonging; so likewise they retaine sinnes, in regard of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall penaltie, when they enioyne penance vnto the delinquent to be performed: a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine approued in all ages, euen from the time of the primitiue Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nether is there wanting sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to make a full remonstrance hereof, that it was, and is most agreeable to Gods holy will and pleasure, that in the Sacrament of pennance, a certaine mulct and penaltie should be enioyned by his priests, vpon such as had notoriously offended and transgressed his lawes, which is not enioyned to those who are regenerat by the sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. For Baptisme being but only a meane to regenerat, it was not much behouefull that man should labour much therin, but so it is not (nor no reason it should be) in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance after Baptisme, for here the soule is sick, wounded and languishing with many diseases, and penance is the salue and medecine, to heale the parts ill affected.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:181278:28"/> It is then most aggreable vnto reason, that the partie patient should suffer (before he be cured) the smarting corosiues, sharpe mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, bitter potions, and deepe incisions; for it is the course of iustice, that selfe doe, must selfe haue, and that so far forth as he hath o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerlashed in the delight of pleasure, he should a while groone vnder the heauie burthen of paine: and that the priest to whom is beque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed this power in earth, should not absolue sinfull delinquents, but by imposing penance vpon them. Otherwise most Christians would become careles and negligent in all good workes, conceiuing a deceitfull security of their owne saluation, thorough the sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Christs satisfaction, and so would vse (as too too many doe in this corrupt time of heresie) Christs satisfaction and redemption, as a cloake to couer their careles, slouthfull, and dissolute liues.</p>

And like as when any of these members are persecuted, him selfe in like sort is persecuted: so when any of his members doth any satisfactorie workes, he him selfe doth worke them, and doth satisfie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon is euidentlie to be deduced, that our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is not in vaine, albeit our Sauiour Christ hath sufficiently satisfied, and paid our rāsome vpon the Crosse: no more then Christ now sitting at the right hand of his Father, praying sufficiently for vs al, hath so frustrated all our prayers, that wee neede not to pray.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seeing then our satisfaction may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable before the throane of mercie, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting chiefly of those deedes and acts, which are especially accompted our owne, we may

By almes, we sacrifice our substance: by fasting our bodies: by praier, our soules.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hence hath it proceeded, that the good ould father S. Hierom, and with him many other holy Saints and seruants of God, so hewed and tewed their tender flesh, by broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the preaching heates of sommer, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and quaking in the bitter stormes of winter, trauelled with afflictions, ouer-worne with fasting, watching, abstinence, cruel and excessiue chasticements, to suppres the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious swelling of their flesh, bearing volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarilie the crosse of tribulation here in earth, to make their better passage into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Hence it is, that hair-cloth and ashes, haue bene so highlie in esteeme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the cheefest seruants and friends of God. Hence proceeded watching and prayer, night after night, with voluntarie sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:181278:30"/> and exile from the world, liue in vncoth and desert places, with frequentation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie godlie, austere and spirituall exercises.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To conclude therfore, let vs here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould, the incomprehensible goodnes, of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, who as he hath prouided hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes &amp; remedies for the diseases of the bodie, so hath he likewise done for the diseases of the soule For the soule being no lesse subiect to the malice of sinne, to spiritual infirmities, languishing diseases, often relapses and the like, it had bene il prouided of almightie God, where there is such procliuitie to sundry sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, if no conuenient remedy or phisick had bene prepared. And for as much as all euill humors are purged ether by potion or vomit; and aboundance of blood, by phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie and incision of veines: euen so are all the sinnes of the soule healed and cured, ether by Baptisme, or sacramentall satisfaction, by curbing the rebellious rancor of the flesh. Hence it is, that Baptisme may be rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to a potion and purgation: which as it is an externall liquor, and is receiued by the mouth, so the water of Baptisme, being sprinkled vpon the bodie, cleanseth the soule with great facilitie, and washeth downward euen from the crowne of the head, to the plant of the foote, the filth and blemishes of the soule. But penance is another manner of phisick, a vomit, as it were, much more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:181278:30"/> which working first in the stomach, draweth euery humor vnto one part, raising it vpward, and violently expelling them by the mouth: beginning first in the hart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, but yet with torment, griping, and at the last with loathing and abhorring and vomiting of the soule, raising vp all from the bottom of the stomach to the tongue, to cast it out by the mouth; And as most purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and vomits, worke best by the helpe of heate: so in this purgation, there must be a spirituall heate and feruor, with a hart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and loathsomnes of body and flesh, with a continuall burning and loue of the soule, ioyned with true detestation of sinne, to make full recompence and satisfaction to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N regard of the manifould benefits that doe redound by this holy Sacrament vnto the houshold and familie of Christ our Lord, may easilie be gathered the necessitie thereof, and that the same neuer proceeded from the inuention of man, nor from no other, then from the institution of Iesus Christ and his holy Spirit: sith long experience doth now shew the same to be, so holie and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a thinge in the Church of God, and so conuenient for euery Christian common welth. For if ether we consider, the maiestie of almightie God, or his pastors and prelates presiding in his Church, or the Church it selfe militant here on earth, or the faithfull who are the flock, and familie of Iesus Christ, we shall plainly perceiue the wonderfull benefit, of absolution and confession to a priest.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First therfore, if we consider the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull goodnes of almightie God, we may see in this worke of the priests absolution, the vnspeakable clemencie and mercie of Christ, who doth not wrest and wrinch out our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, like vnto earthly princes and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to confound and condemne vs, but as a most milde and carefull phisitian, doth suffer his deputies to reuewe our woundes, and gentlely to touche and handle them, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:181278:31"/> then to heale vs. Nether yeth doth he so shew his mercie, as that he vtterly ommitteth his iustice, but doth in this Sacrament make vse of both, ballancing our pride with humilitie, and abating euery sinners courage by humble confession, enioyning those that haue bene notorious delinquents, to vndergoe for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the shame and confusion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That vtilitie cometh hereby to pastors and curates of soules appeareth, sith by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, they vnderstand the griefes, hart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, diseas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, and euery particular soare of their flock and charge, wherby in due season, they may prepare to eache a redres and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient remedy, to worke vpon their weaknes with their great wisdome, their ignorance with their great knowledg, their vnconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie with their grauitie, their disorders with their zeale and care, and so safely conduct them by the path of goodnes and pietie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard of the whole Church, how behouefull it is to the weale publique, it is not so hard to see, but that euen the shortest-sighted man may behould: sith that in exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior courts, the iudges oftentimes disguise matters, studie for long delaies, heape suites one vpon another, and when the parties deale most sincerely, yet hardly can they bring the controuersie to an end. Where contrarie-wise we see with how smale labour &amp; how soone,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:181278:32"/> priests in the court of conscience, haue brought many from the heates of anger to a mylde spirit, and tractable to yeld to any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of reformation; Yea it is auerred in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Christian nation, that many difficulties which time could neuer moderat, or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable coniecture be accorded, (as hath bene experienced in thousands of quarrels of great personages, whom nether friendes could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, nor enimies feare, nor gould allure, nor other presents reclayme) yet being afterwards brought vnder Benedicite, when time hath had his full course, there hath bene found great facilitie, to end that which before see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med difficil, yea rather plainly desperat to determine. For it being the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of confession, to change the mindes of men, and their passions, &amp; to impart to new men, new affections, presently restitution is made of former wronges offered, heates of furie sodainlie quenched, vnlawfull contracts annulled, and guilfull bargaines dissolued whence ensueth a well setled cōmon-welth, in all good order and gouernment. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit some few goe as bruit catle to the water and drinke not, yet as the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb saith, one Swallow or two, makes no sommer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An other speciall benefit that those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue who goe to confession as they ought, besides their reconciliation to God, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:181278:32"/> of their sinnes is, that ordinarilie they haue giuen them aduised councell, godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, great confort and consolation, quiet and tranquillitie of conscience for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes past, remedie and redres for falling into mischiefes to come; God hauing so linked confession, with shame and confusion (shā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes being the mother of virtu) that for shame oftentimes man leaues to sinne, when the sweetnes therof doth greatly entice him to the contrarie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now then, take away and abolish auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confession (as wicked heretiques haue done at this day) and tell me whither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths are better gouerned, suites &amp; quarrels sooner ended, controuersies spede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier decided, the feare of God better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, whither wemen be more chast, men more virtuous, children more obedient, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants more trustie, masters better pay-masters friendes more faithfull, lay-people more iust in their dealinges, cleargie men more deuout in praying, or whither there is more religiō, feare of God, faith, fidelitie and conscience among all estates, or rather continuall fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation of euill, vanting of wickednes, yea rather impudent publishing of thinges abhominable, following the cursed crew of Sodom and Gomorrah, to whom it was no more shame to sinne, then to eate, as though there were no woord of God to prohibit, nor
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:181278:33"/> any God at all to punish such execrable crymes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hence then we may well conclude, sith the most earnest desire of our fore-fathers, the scope and drift of all philosophers, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and indeauors of all law-makers, the care and vigilancie of all soueraignes, was to instruct in their common-wealths, how to liue well, and how to die well, the only meanes then in our Christian cōmon-welth, and the chiefest sinnew from whence virtu and godlines doth arise, being the holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confession, and priests absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Christ who is our eternall Father, the best philosopher, the wisest law-maker, the greatest polititian, &amp; our sacred and most dread soueraigne, shall we thinke him, I say, to be so careles to redres or to appoint a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or so far to let loose the reynes of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie (him selfe treading so painfull and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a path) as to suffer vs to runne headlong without care of conscience, to liue like disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes, to die without regard of soule or body, and not wiselie to haue prescribed vs the soundest way?</p>
            <p n="7">7. To conclude, many Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues doe auouch, that Catholiques doe wel in going to confession, being the doctrine of their owne booke of common prayer, the plaine wordes and exhortation of S. Iames, to confes one to another, and the manifest
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:181278:33"/> truth of Christ vnto his Apostles, &amp; in them, to their successors, to forgiue sinnes. Is it not then (good Christian) in cases so desperat as this, yea so doubtfull and ambiguous as euen Protestants make it, that seeing all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ouer (some few parts excepted) deny al saluatiō, to such as vtterly reiect priests abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, yea and that the far lesser part (which is the Protestant) can not gayne say, but that it is a most ancient practise, a right godly vse, nothing derogatiue to Gods honor and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or lesse hindrance to the atchieuing of heauen, and fruition of all eternall happines, may not we then truly conclude, that it is far more secure to follow the Catholique o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and that secure passage (though som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what about as they say) then to follow the Protestants shorter cut, truly too too vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and too too dainty away, for such as truly should follow Christ: and this but an opinion also of a few?

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ohn Caluin, albeit he could not abide papistrie by day-light, and thorough the grosse sighted spectacles of his soaring conceit, giue any good look vpon this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of auricular Confession, yet he ranging into the practise of former times (as though he would haue swept away the dust and cob-webbes of those vnciuill and vnlearned ages) out of his vnwonted kindnes, giues auricular confession this honest pasport, to wit, that it hath been practised for many hundred yeares. And though perhaps I might well borrow so fauorable a blast of this mans mouth, for proofe of antiquitie in our behalfe, yet this is not the vpshot of our game, to stand only vpon this point of ancient custome, and so to make it but an ecclesiasticall law, decree, or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:181278:34"/> positiue constitution: but my meaning is, to get a further start, and to proue with reason, that as confession hath the prerogatiue of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vse and custome, so withall to carry the countenance of Apostolicall tradition, and certaintie of Christs owne ordination and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And first, sith that confession vnto priests, and by them the absolution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, hath been in the Church of God, before all decrees of Popes or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels (as shall hereafter manifestly appeare) and not only long before the first generall councell of Nice, but before all other ether nationall or prouinciall whatsoeuer, it can not therfore be, that confession should be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the compas of any humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, sith all human decrees are circumferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, within the knowledge of time and place, when and where, in what age, vnder what Councell and Pope they had their first begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which this hath not, and therfore came directly from Christ. Thus much may be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, concerning the very substance of the commandement of sacramentall confession, to wit, that it is necessarie to saluation, euen by Christs owne institution. For in that Christ instituted the end, he instituted likewise the meanes to obtaine the end: and so giuing his Apostles power to remit or retaine sinnes, he withall ordained confession of the same sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:181278:35"/> For sinnes (as hath been said) can not be duly remitted, vnles they be knowen: and knowledg of sinnes, especially of secret, can not be had of man (who seeth not the hart) but by confession of sinnes. It therfore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth consequentlie, that they receiued au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to heare confessions, and that the same was instituted by Christ him selfe; for this forme of argument vsed S. Aug. (epist. ad Ian. 118.) that where we found a doctrin to be receiued into the vniuersall Church. and that no begining can be shewed thereof. it is to be held, that it proceeded imediatly from Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againe, for as much as the generall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of auricular confession in all Christian contries, could not otherwise proceed at first, but by a commandment, (it not being easie by rigor of law, to command the mightiest monarch to confes and manifest his secret sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) no human power could enforce or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand sinners, to make their confession of their secret sinnes; which is most euident. For man can not make a law, but only for that whereof he can iudge, but he can nether iudge nor pierce the thoughts of the hart, no more then the breath of his mouth, can pierce the strongest glasse of steele, therfore no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power can command or make a law to enforce such secret cōfession of sinnes vnto a priest. And be it that there were a law, truth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:181278:35"/> enforcing sinners to confes, yet would it be still in the freedome of man, what he would confes: and so it would rather be a burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some knee-labor, then any way ether hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some or beneficiall vnto the soule. Therfore, sith man doth confes (and maketh therof a matter of conscience) it should be absurd to imagin, that it was an human law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and not the expres command and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law of Iesus Christ enforcing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Moreouer, if we consider the heauie burthen of Confession, and compare the same with the manifold heauie burdens that were laid vpon the backs of the people of God from the first begining, we shall see that this burthen which is now laid vpon the backs of Christians, will be a yoke and burthen far more painfull, then any of all those that euer was imposed or supported by our predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. For it is apparant, that of all those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which Catholike Christians doe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, the precepts they obserue, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments they accomplish, the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they practise, and the sacrifices they offer, that to make confession of their secret mortall sinnes vnto another man, is the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest and most rigorous of all the rest. For what can be more contrarie to our corrupt and proud nature, then to accuse our selues of our most horrible secret sinnes? which euery man by all meanes possible will seeke
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:181278:36"/> to hide, and is most ready to excuse The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son wherof is, as Plato obserueth, because to whom we disclose a secret, to him we sell our freedom and libertie. And what I pray you can be more yrksom or more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some (especially to such as liue at such liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the mightiest monarches and most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent princes) then to prostrate them selues at the feete of a Priest, and to open and confes vnto him, the horrible plots, horrid murders, and filthie adultries which they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and as it were impairing the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their owne tribunall, to be bound and subiect to obey to that of the Priest?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now then, sith plaine experience doth teache vs, that thinges which are difficult to be done, we can hardly be induced to doe them, euen then when they are commanded to be done, who is of so short or shallow iudgment, as once to imagine, that so many Popes, Cardinalls, Archbishops, Bishops Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and religious persons, with the whole residue of the learned cleargie, and withall so many Christian Emperors, Kinges, Dukes, Earles, and Barons, with all the magistrats and common people thoroughout all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, would, or could haue entertained a law so longe, and that so exceeding bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome to flesh and blood, if it had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the expresse commandment of Iesus Christ? Moyses gaue a law vnto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:181278:36"/> Solon to the Greekes, Pheroneus to the Egiptians, Numa Pompilius to the Romans, but as men made them, and as men died, so were they ended and abolished after their deathes. But this law of confession hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so many hundred yeares, nor could it euer hitherto be put downe, though some carnall Capharintes, and late illuminated apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata Friars and priestes, as Friar Luther, Friar Bucer, Calum, Beza and such like other run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negate priests, haue opposed and gain-said it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Therfore, sith Confession is a yoke and heauie burden, and euery yoke naturally is sharp, hard and painfull to beare, and that the beast that draweth the same goeth bound and trauelled, and sith that so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands haue notwithstāding all this, obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put this yoake of confession vpon their neckes, and yet doe lightly and confortably beare and carry away this burden, it must nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des follow by good reason, that it is the yoke of Iesus Christ, whose yoke is sweet and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light. They are the burdens of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that doe loade vs, and ouerthrow vs: they are the burdens of the world, that are greuous and intollerable vnto vs: they are the burdens of the flesh, which into sundry sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes enthrall and ingulfe vs: but the burthens of Christ are comfortable vnto vs: for he doth lighten vs when he doth load vs, giue vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie when he yokes vs, and iointly draweth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:181278:37"/> with vs by his loue &amp; grace in the same yoke.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sith then the substance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of sacramentall Confession, hath not, nor cannot be proued to haue proceeded from any human decree or institution, vpon the premisses, I frame this argument. Ether this absolution and forgiuenes of sinnes by Priests, which hath beene practised in the Church of God so many hundred yeares, and which all Christians haue held in so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and estimation, together with the Priests chalenging such an vniuersall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their tribunalls, aboue all earthly princes and potentates, hath his authoritie, warrant and certaintie from Christ, or not. If it hath, then the matter is ended, and the question fully decided: for it followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, that the Catholique faith concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning confession and Priests absolution is both true and vpright doctrine, yea commanded by Christ him selfe, without any derogation at all vnto his glorie. If it hath not, that is to say, if it be not true, nor haue not the countenance of Christs owne command, then doe but tell me, how credible it is, that such a grosse error, and of so long time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, could be brought into the Church of God, ether by prince or by prelat, yea who he was that durst first preache or perswade to the people, so grosse, notorious and palpable a lie? Or what wise men of the magistracie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:181278:37"/> and common-welth, would suffer themselues to be thus hampered with so harsh a law, and so subiect themselues to earthly men, to Gods dishonor? Ot why were there not councells called to confound it, and doctors of the Church to preach against it: who yet haue euer been so vigilant, that they haue quickly espied and discouered euen the least error?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Seeing then this doctrin of priests abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, hath been entertained so longe, and that by the wisest and mightiest men; and seeing againe that it is most improbable, that men would so easilie suffer them selues to be angled with words, to confes to a poore priest, the most secret and the greatest sinnes that euer they committed; or be brought to the same by the force &amp; constraint of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall command, when the thing it selfe had no warrant from Gods word, nor obligation in conscience; it clearly followeth for the rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons afore-said, that this doctrin of auricular confession, is the very doctrine of Christ him selfe, by his owne authoritie first instituted, by the Apostles practised, by the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, by the fathers preached, and by all good and godly people to haue been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and so from time to time vntill this present, as a most diuine and holie Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iesus Christ, euermore esteemed and approued</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr blessed Sauiour (Math. 9.) vpon a cure donne to the sicke of the palsie, takethe an occasion to confute the maisters of the Iewes, as then most eager in the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency of their witts, to gainsay his preistly power of remittinge sinnes here in earth, as he was the sonne of man. The which (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering their blasphemous speeches against him, their pretence being, that almighty God onely forgeue the sinnes) he confutethe very euidently, bothe with sound and grounded reasons, and with most apparant miracles. And although our sauiour might haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Iewes, that albeit it were admitted, that the power of remittinge sinnes were so peculiar to God, that it could not be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated nor done by any any humaine mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, yet notwithstanding he was not to be accused of blasphemy, because he was the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:181278:38"/> true and euer liuinge God, and therfore might and could forgiue and remit sinnes, where it best beseemed his diuine and holy pleasure. Howebeit our Sauiour stoode not with the Iewes vpon that pointe, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly proued and declared, that that power to remitt sinnes (which he then exercised) was giuen to him as he was the sonne of man (marc. 2. luc. 5.) A truthe most apparant euen by the other three Euangelists; for where they record this fact and discourse of our Sauiour with the Iewes, they vse preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely one forme of woords, namely, that the sonne of man hath this power, beinge as it were a parcell of the more generall commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion signified and conteyned in these woords Iohn. 5. <hi>Omne iudicium dedit filio,</hi> he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all iudgment to the sonne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it is more aduisedly to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how that in most vniforme and expresse manner it is sett downe in all the holy Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, that that power which was giuen to the sonne of man to forgiue sinnes, was spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified here more particularly to be done <hi>(in terra)</hi> in the earthe, that is to be exercised here in earthe in visible sorte by woords, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall act, outward ceremony, and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall order, and not onely by Gods inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grace, supereminent power, sole and ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate working. An vndeniable apparance he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof may be, sith that the holy scripture and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:181278:39"/> our Sauiour himselfe in the case of bindinge and loosinge specifieth a double kind of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: one appertaininge to God, which is called bindinge and loosinge of sinnes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; the other exercised by man, which is tearmed binding and loosing of sinnes in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the. So that our Sauiour keepinge in this place (in controuersy with the Iewes) the same distinction and opposition (of heauen and earthe) of remittinge in heauen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting in earthe, which is done by visible and externall woord or action here in this world; chokethe the stiffenecked Iewes, who charged him to vsurpe Gods onely office and prerogatiue in remitting sinnes, and so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth them, that he as man remitteth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in earth, God himselfe remittinge them in heauen,</p>
            <p n="3">3. And to knitt vp but the force of our sauiours argument and answere here vnto the Iewes, in few woords as may be plainely and truly gathered out of his owne speeches, it may easily appeare, that they are able to centeruaile such exceptions as might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against him, and that such autority is not lightly to be shaken of by euery turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heade: First then he answereth, wheras yee, o Iewes, obiect blasphemy vnto my chardge, because I forgiue sinnes, which you say is proper onely to God, yee must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thus much, that it is noe lesse proper to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:181278:39"/> man to woork miracles, then to forgiue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: But I haue made it cleere and manifest vnto your owne eyes, that God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated power vnto me as man, to work miracles, why then may not he giue me like power also (as man) to remit sinnes?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Againe, it is noe more blasphemy to say vnto the sinner, thy sinnes be forgiuen, then to the impotent take vp thy couche and walke. But your selues accompt it noe blasphemy, in sayinge the one, why should yee then accompt it blasphemy in saying the other? In truth therfore the scope of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours argument against the Iewes being such, &amp; his reasōs so inuincible, did so posesse the minds of the more godlie sorte, of the hearers and standers by, that euen by them it seemed to be an vndeniable apparance, sith they by sequel of Christes disputation, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God that gaue such power to men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt sinnes. Which albeit they knewe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayned to God onely by nataue, yet they well perceiued that it might be donne by mans ministery in earth to the glory of God. These true beleeuers referringe that to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Gods honour, which the turbulent Iewes and heretikes did accompt as blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and most iniurious to his sacred maiestie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nowe then (courteouse reader) not to beate against the harte of all Christian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, our sauiours former discourse well and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:181278:40"/> aduisedly considered, forasmuch as his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall power and regiment ouer our soules, which he receiued from aboue (as man &amp; as he is preist &amp; the head of the Church) is the very ground &amp; foundation of all the power of preisthoode exercised now in the Catholik Church: &amp; by the force of our Sauiour Christs argument and answer here to the Iewes, may be both plainely and truly gathered, that his preists and pastors of his Church as men, by his most holy and sacred commission, haue noe lesse authority to forgiue and remitt sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, hauinge committed vnto them the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of reconciliation, beinge noe dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to his glory, Christe himselfe beinge still the principall woorker, men beinge onely his ministers and substitutes, woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge vnder him, and by his commission and auctority.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For, but to entertaine the same force of argument with the Protestants, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did with the Iewes, concerninge his Apostles and preists forgiuinge of sinnes, if it be most cleere and manifest, that Christ hath communicated this power to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to woorke miracles, to raise the dead, to cure all diseases, and with their very sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to woork straunge effects (beinge a like facile and easy, as to remitt sinnes) why then shall it be thought as a matter imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge impossibilitie, for his priests &amp; pastors

            <p n="8">8 But Christ, hath communicated this power of forgiuing sinnes to man: for how plaine are the woords of the commission gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them. <hi>As my Father sent me, so also I send you;</hi> therupon geuinge them the holy ghost.

Beinge then that his father sent him as man to forgiue sinnes, he himselfe saying math. 9. that the sonne of man hath power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes, so also it followeth, that in their commission he giues them the like power. For it is by congruency of all reason, if that Christ hath power as man to forgiue sinne, and that his father sent him to forgiue sinnes, sendinge therfore his Apostles as he was sent himselfe, must of necessity be for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his flock and remission of sinnes.</p>

The forme and phrase of speach of forgiuing sinnes is vsuall in the holy scripture, and there it doeth not signify preachinge of forgiuenesse of sinnes, but an actuall and reall remission, as when Christ said to the sick man of the palsey, to Mary Magdalen Luc. 5. <hi>thy sinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> and not soe that I onely preach forgiuenesse of sinnes. And so when Christ saieth, <hi>Take the holy ghost whose sinnes yee forgiue &amp;c.</hi> all circumstance considered, as giuinge them the holy ghost, the declaringe of his large and ample commission howe he sent them, make a full remonstrance, that he imparted vnto them a full power and commission to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue and remitt, euen as the woords stand, and not to preach onely &amp; declare the same.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the prophets also preached to sinners to repent them of their sinnes and to beleeue, and that by the Messias they should

But the ghospell and absolution by Christ without exception is to be preached to all, and not to be limited or tied to any. For Marc. vlt. he spoake in generall tearmes, preach without

            <p n="7">7. For if it be onely a bare declaration, that our sinnes are forgiuen, this declaration must either be rashe, or superfluouse: for when the minister doeth pronounce these words <hi>(thy sinnes are forgiuen)</hi> that is, I declare thy sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are forgiuen, either he pronounceth this absolutelie, or onely by supposition, that is, if thou beleeuest, or doest penance as thou oughtest.

And albeit the minister might haue some notice of it, yet the penitent knowes better then he, in what case he standeth and therfore needs not the ministers declaration or preachinge absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which can a certaine him noe more of forgiuenesse, then he was assured of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

Wherfore this legacy and power of reconcilinge, importeth a power withall to knowe distinctly euery offence, and so to heare their confessions, &amp; consequently to reconcile the delinquents.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But because some may surmise &amp; graunt perhaps, that the Apostles onely might haue, and had such like auctority onely for that time, yet limited in such sorte that as with them it had his beginninge, soe wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h them in like manner it had his endinge; To such supposals, it may be plainely answered out of S.

Wherfore if Christ (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="10">10. To conclude then, in the Apostles there can be no lack towching this priestly office, for the execution wherof, thy receiued both Christes commission, and the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God afterwardes. In Christ there can be no default, who was well able to giue, and indeed did giue the holy ghost. In the holy ghost there can be noe lett or lack, whose power is infinite, and is very properly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt sinnes. All things standinge on so safe and secure grownds, the geuer, the gift, and the receiuers competent; the time, the place, and manner answerable; the woords, the commission, the power, plaine and absolute, can not but demonstrate vnto vs, the full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority of preists absolution and forgeuinge of sinnes. Wherfore all circumstances consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, if a man should aske a preist, how he dare to be so bould, as to exercise any of these high functions vpon Christes woords, he may make this answer; I baptise, because all power is giuen to Christ. I remitt sinnes, and I absolue because in my ministery Christ practiseth daily all these functions; In his power I am become a lawefull woorker of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:181278:53"/> all these actions, that are so proper to Christ him selfe. Wherfore, saieth S. Augustin (tract. 4. 56,) it was Christ that baptised, &amp; that had moe disciples then S. Iohn, &amp; yet Christ baptised not, but his disciples onely.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Well then, thus I inferr; That power and commission which was giuen to Christ by his heauenly father, concerninge remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, was giuen to his Apostles at his departure: but Christ him selfe did truly, effectually, and in proper forme by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sendinge and commission, as man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt sinnes: Ergo the ministers of Christ doe and may, truly remitt sinnes. Or thus; As Christ was sent of his father, so are the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles sent by Christ: but Christ was sent to forgiue sinnes: Ergo the Apostles were sent to forgiue sinnes. Againe whatsoeuer the holy ghost may doe in this case, and by the power of his God head, that may the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and preists doe by seruice and ministery, through the power of the holy ghost which they receiued: but the holy ghost rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits sinns: therfore the Apostles in like sorte, truly and rightly remitt sinnes. Soe hereby it followeth that Christ is the cheefe minister, according to his manhoode of all our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement to God, and for him as ministers, the Apostles their successors, the bishops and preists of his church (in whom the woord of reconcilement, as well by ministringe of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:181278:54"/> sacrifice and sacraments for remission of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as by preachinge and gouernement of the church to saluation) ar placed; whose ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution and remission of sinnes, is to vs, as if Christ him selfe did remitt and forgiue; their absolution and remission, beinge Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes owne pardon, their whole office, beinge nothing els, but the vicarship of Iesus Christ.</p>

And for as much as it is said confessinge their sinnes, it is not vnderstoode that they confessed in general tearmes, that they were sinners, transgressors, highely offendinge the maiestie of God, but that they confessed in particular their sinnes and not to be sinners onely, as noe doubt the Iewes as yet were obseruant of their lawes, though they were defectiue in many things, and therfore comminge to confession and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

               <head>The doctrine concerninge this forgeeuinge of sinnes by Christ as he was man</head>
               <p>It is to be noted, that vniformely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, all the Euangelists sett downe, that power was giuen to the sonne of man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes. <hi>In terra,</hi> here in earth; for it is not be doubted but that he had alwayes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in heauen, as he was the sonne of God, to remitt sinnes. Whereby we may also note a double kind of operation, one appertayning to god, which is bindinge and loosinge in heauen: and another exercised by man, which is bindinge and losinge of sinnes in earthe, the forgiuinge of sinnes here in earthe was to be donne after a visible sorte by woords, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acte, ceremony or sacrament, and not onely by gods inuisible grace or by gods sole and imediate operation or woorkinge. So that our sauiour obseruinge this distinction, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference the pardonning there in heauen, from pardonninge here in earth, tearmeth this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittinge of sinnes in earth, which man doth by externall and visible action here in this world. Wherupon when the Iewes chard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:181278:69"/> our Sauiour with blasphemy for remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge sinnes, and to take and vsurpe gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and prerogatiue therin, he answereth them, that this power which he now exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, was giuen to him as the sonne of man, &amp; when he might haue said, he did it as God yet he stoode not vpon this, but tould them he did it as man, because he is the sonne of man, <hi>quia filius hominis est;</hi> So that remittinge and retaininge sinnes, was a parcell of a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerale commissiō conteined in these woords. <hi>Omne iudicium dedit filio:</hi> Ioannis 5. he gaue all iudgement to his sonne. Wherby we may perceiue that Christ when he remitts sinnes as God, the meanninge therof is not, that he according to this phrase of scripture is said to remitt sinnes in earth but in heauen, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise he forgeuinge sinnes as man, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them here in earth by visible and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fact. Wherfore as Christ proueth vnto the Iewes that himselfe as man, and not as God onely, hath power to remitt sinnes, by that in all their sights he was able to doe miracles, and make the sick man sodenly to arrise: so Christ Iesus our Lord hauinge graunted to his Apostles to doe miracles, he may in like sorte communicate aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God (though they be not God) to remitt sinnes as gods, ministers. And here it is, that as the Iewes chardged Christ for forgiuinge sinnes with blasphemy, so do the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:181278:70"/> protestants charge the preists of gods church for doing the same: Wheras by Christs owne woords, it may be euidently shewed, that as to woork miracles is onely proper to God, and yet may be communicated to man: soe may the power to forgiue sinnes, wherupon the multitude glorified God, that gaue such power to men, Christ himselfe beinge heade, and our cheefe pastor. No marueile then saieth S. Ierome, ad Heliod. epist. 1. that preists hauing the keies of the kingdom hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen iudge after a sorte before the day of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement. And it is noe marueil, for Christ wrought the selfe same things in earth by seruice, suite, and commission, which before onely he did by might and maiesty, and by his owne absolute power; And therfore now become the sonne of man, ordeineth a new manner of reconciliation, offereth sacrifice as a preist for sinne, vseth ceremonies, externall actions, visible figures &amp; Sacraments, praieth to God his Father, and all this accordinge to his humaine nature.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch then, as confession (as hitherto hath bene manifested) both in the lawe of nature, as also in the law of Moyses, hath not couertly bene expressed, and shadowed, but exacted at the hands of the seruants of god, yea and expressely commanded, in soe much that some of the protestants as Kemnisius. p. 908. bouldly affirmeth (yet to a wronge pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)

Hilary agreeinge in the same truth, faleth into this exclamation. O happy foundation of the church in the imposinge of the new name, yet moreouer S. Leo Epist. 89 addeth, that our Lord would that the Sacrament or mistery of this gift, soe to pertaine to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of all the Apostles, that from him as from a certaine head, he might power out his guiftes as it were through the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

                     <p>Now that Christ here ordained a courte, a consistory, a seate of iudgement in his church, appointinge the Apostles and their successors to be iudges, is most apparant by S.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:181278:74"/> any other then from that wherof it was said, what things yee bynd in earth, they shalbe bound also in heauen. Here it is that S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome sayeth, lib. de dignit. Sacerd. lib. 3. in hom. 5. de verbis Esai. vidi Dominū, that Christ translated all iudgement which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of his father vnto the Apostles and preists, and that the sentence of Peter remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge sinnes, goeth before the sentence of heauen. As noe lesse auerrethe. S. Hilarie in Math. 16. sayinge; Blessed is the porter of heauen, whose earthely iudgement (that is which is giuen here in earth) is afore iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged auctority in heauen. Whereupon Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor Naz in his sermon to the president of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended &amp; cytizens amased with feare, boldly vttereth these woords. O you rulers, the law of Christ hath assubiected you to my rule, sea, and auctority, for we are with a power farre more ample and perfecter, in so much that S. Gregory hom 26. in Euang. writeth that the Apostles obteined a principality and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of supernaturall iudgement, that in steed of God, to some thy should forgiue, to othersome retaine sinnes. And as first he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis d to Peter and the rest, and so to their successors this high and eminent power, so nowe Io. 20. he saieth, <hi>Accipite</hi> take this power, wherupon he geueth them the holy ghost, and soe instituteth the holy Sacrament of penance, Cirill li. 12. c. 56. in Ioannem.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:181278:74"/> saith further, this auctority of forgeuing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes beinge giuen to the preists, it followeth that the laity must likewise confesse their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Sinnes can not be duly remitted or retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnlesse they be knowne to him that hath auctority to remitt: and knowledg of sinnes (such as are priuy) can not be had but by confession of the sinner, therfore it followeth that they receiued this auctority, to here the confession of Christian people, that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirouse to be assoiled and reconciled: for he that instituteth the end, instituteth also the means, which should be necessary to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyninge of that end. Wherfore S. Hierom. com. in Math. 16. who I thinke vnderstood the woords of Christ sayeth, that the preist, when as accordinge to his office, he hath heard the diuersity of sinnes, he presently knoweth who is to be bound, who is to be loosed. And to answere him that perhaps wil aske, why Christ in expresse tearmes sayd not, Hugoli 2. de Sacr. tra. 14. cap. 1.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:181278:76"/> be sett downe, as many things els were, as alsoe the Apostles beinge confirmed in grace by the comming of the holy ghost vpō them, committed noe such greuouse and mortall sinnes, which their successors might do, and so vse the benefite of reconciliation by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessinge. For sithence in the prime of gods church, Christs blood beinge yet hotte, &amp; the name of a Christian soe deearly sould, euerie one burninge with zele and deuotion, caused that sinne was not so sleyghtly comitted but after, that deuotion became luke warme and freisinge cold, many fell into diuerse enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and so offended God, and needed conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reconciliation, which wee see euery daye to be more needfull then others.</p>
                     <p>Now how this sacramentall confession came to be in vre in other countryes, we may see by diuerse of S. Paules scholers, whom he instructed and sent to teach the same doctrine, which he had taught and informed them, as by S. Crescens bishop of Vienna, S. Trophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius bishop of Arles, S. Denise Areopagite &amp; martyr at Paris, whose doctrine is most plaine for confession as after also S. Crescens and Crescentius beinge S. Paules scholers, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Moguntium to Christianity. In all which places thus conuerted &amp; gouerned euen from the first Apostles till these dayes, confession of sinne to a preist hath bene taught and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that euen euery church hath spoken his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:181278:77"/> owne mothers dialect, and not stept an inche from their conuerters doctrine.</p>
                     <p>And wheras S. Paule willeth to proue our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues before we come to the holy sacrament, and after sayeth if we iudg ourselues, we shal not be iudged, his meaninge is, (as we may gather by the rytes of S. Basiles, and S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes masse) to examine by confession themselues, for so did the preists, sayeth S. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil in this tyme, to prooue and confesse befor they went to the deuine mysteries. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in iudginge ourselues, because man is partial in his owne cause, therfore S. Iames telleth, that we should confesse one to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that not to euery one, but to such as ar iudges, and haue auctority to reconcyle, &amp; to whom it was sayd, whose sinnes ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue ar forgiuen, who ar the preists, whom he willeth the sicke to call in.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:181278:77"/> on gods promise after the confessing of them for the forgiuinge, his promise was Ion. 20. When he sayd to his Apostles and preists, <hi>whose sinnes yee forgiue ar forgiuen,</hi> therfore confessinge to a preist, God is faithfull and iust accordinge to his institution to forgiue. 4. if this confession should be to God, and so by God onely we should haue forgiunes, thē Christ should haue sayd in vaine to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>whose sinnes yee forgiue ar forgiuen,</hi> for beinge more easy to confesse to God then to man, none would go to man, and seeke par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that way. 5. If the confession should be onely to God, if the preist should bynd any and retayne his sinnes, iudgeinge him not woorthy to be loosed, he should dot it in vayne. For he might be absolued by confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe to God alone, whether the preist would or not; so God should not be faithfull &amp; iust hauinge promised this autority to his preists. 6. to make one place of scripture to agree with another and not to be contrary, but to explicate one by the other, it is most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that S.

                     <p>Wee can haue noe greater, nor more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable declaration hereof, that confession was vsed euen in the Apostles time, then of S. Ambrose li. 1. de poenit c. 10. who liued some 380. years after Christ, and who plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely affirmeth in his first booke of penance, that in S. Paules time, it was the custome of the church of God for preists to forgiue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (which they could not do except the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents confessed them) and that without all derogation to Christ. And hence it cometh that euen then S. Iames willeth to confesse, which exhortation to confession sheweth that now the faithfull were acquainted with confession, and that it was accustomed, not onely to confesse to God, but moreouer to man, that is, to some other besids God, and that either priuately or publickly, but nature teacheth vs, that silence and secrecy is best for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:181278:78"/> secret sinnes; then most likely he ment of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confession, and since he bids them confesse to some other besid. God, it is most probable, that he would bid them rather goe to the preist, and confesse their sinnes to him, rather then to any other, hauing bidden them calle in the preists before, as also Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge giuen the Apostles auctority to forgiue sinnes: for els why should they confesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some absolution or forgiuenesse therby might be had? if for comefort, yet more to preists, who haue the holy ghost giuen them the comeforter. For els man, as man (houlds so much of flesh and so littell of spirit) that knowinge his neighbours faults, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when time serues, lay it in his dishe, then to releeue him with spirituall comeforte.</p>
                     <p>Besides as S Iames here bids them calle in the preists, it is most likely, talkinge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, remission of sinnes, and to be saued, that as he would haue the preists to annoile the sick, soe the preists should be those to whom we should confesse to haue our sinnes forgiuen, which preists Ioan. 20. can forgiue sinnes. Confesse therfore one to an other, that is, man to man, that is, thou that doest want absolution, vnto them that haue power to giue absolution, therfore confesse your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Why? because it was said before, if he be in sinne, the sinne shalbe remitted him: who shall remitt them, if it not the preists
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:181278:79"/> that are called in? And why more the preists then any other? because to them it is said Ion. 2. <hi>Whose sinnes yee forgiue are forgiuen.</hi> This place Origen, Hom. 2. in Leuit. Chrisost. li 3. de Sacerd. S. August. Hom. 12. ex lib. 50. Hom. S. Bernard in his booke of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions c. 9. expound of that confession which is made vnto a preist. And therfore say these doctors, when S. Iames saieth one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is ment (as the sequele of the woords of the scripture require, pray one for an other, confesse one to an other) of preists who must pray for the sick, not the sick for the preists, confesse yee sick to the preist, and not the preists to the sick, and therfore the preists ar called in to annoyle, to pray, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confession to absolue: for if they be in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, their sinnes shalbe remitted. Wherefore no doubt these doctors thought that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was vsed euen in the primitiue churche, and with such as were sick, &amp; so they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood S. Iames. Neyther is it probable that S. Iames ment as our protestants doe, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preachinge of forgiuinge of sinnes by Christe, is auayleable enough, and that by onely faith, to saluation: for what needed he then bid them confesse one to an other that they may be saued, when onely beleefe of forgiuenesse without confession, had beene sufficient? S. Basil moouinge a questiō about confession asketh, whether it must be to all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:181278:79"/> men, or to some in particuler, or to the preists onely: he answereth, sith confession is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to shewe fruits woorthy of penance, it is thought requisite, <hi>Confitenda esse peccata quibus dispēsatio misteriorum Dei committitur,</hi> to confesse to them, to whom the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the misteries of God is committed.</p>

                     <p>About this time, the Nouatians procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge from one Nouatus, renewed the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy of the Montanists some 50. years after. In so much that Socrates in his fourth book of his history, testifieth that Nouatus their captaine should write vnto all churches (for he had gotten auctority in beinge made a mocke bishop by stelth and not by canonical order) that no sinner should be admitted vnto the holy misteries, that had sacrificed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, soe that his doctrine was to exhort them
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:181278:89"/> onely to penance, and for the rest, to remitt wholy the forgiuenesse of their sinnes to God onely, who could and had onely auctority to forgiue sinnes. Here note 1. if our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries grownd their negatiue doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyinge confession to a preist vpon Nouatus, then it proceedeth and hath its beginninge from one that in his youth was possessed with an euel spirite, a coniurer, a man putt into orders against all order and lawe, a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop made by stelth and by intrusion 2. if his doctrine should be true, why would then Christ suffer his church to be in error in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessinge, and preists absoluinge, either till the Montanists beganne, or till now some 255. years, when Christ said he would be with his Apostles till the worlds end, to teach go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and direct thē with his holy spirit in all truth, and now in the beginninge should fall into heresy and vtter blindnesse? 3. the practise of confession and preists absolution from all sinne, was then the practise of the church, or els why did Nouatus now deny it, and forbid all penitents to seek absolution, and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenesse in the church but of God onely, being contradicted for his doctrine of all? 4. if No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatus doctrine be true, then is the other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of confession false, why then did not Nouatus call a councell, and condemne his predecessors and former bishops of heresy? but this we neuer reade, but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:181278:89"/> that the Nouatians were censured for heretickes for denyinge absolution, as shall presently appeare. 5. the Montanists and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians did not denie but that preists might preach and teach forgiuenesse of sinnes by Christ, but denyed that power to absolue was giuen them Ion. 20. whose sinnes ye forgiue are forgiuen, therfore in contradictinge the church, it is plaine that the meanninge of the woords of Christ Ihon 20. was vnderstood of the whole church then for preists to forgiue sinnes and absolue, and not to preach onely forgiuenesse of sinne.</p>

                     <p>Against this heresy of Nouatus, was held a councell at Rome by Pope Cornelius of 50. bishops, as many preists, and many more deacons, where it was examined and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. And albeit the decrees of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell are not extant, yet Eusebius Coesariensis in his sixt book of his ecclesiasticall history and 34. chapter, geueth sufficient testimony of it. Moreouer the councell of Nice held this heresy of Nouatus so damnable, that it prohibited, that none of this sort should be receiued againe into the lapp of gods church and participation of the holy misteries, except by publicke abiuration of that heresy, they promised to folowe the prescript order, all precepts and commandements of the holy

After that Nouatus had begun his heresy, it was thought conuenient to certaine bishops, to appointe a penitentiary preist for euery publick and notoriouse delinquent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse vnto, and to do publick penance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be admitted to come to the holy Eucharist: for before the heresy of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatus began, not any were compelled to goe to any certain preist, neither to confesse pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly their sinne, albeit some accustomed by counsell of the preist to confesse some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouse crime publickly, for their more confusion and repentance, hauinge trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed publickly, yet they were not bound vnto it, but it was sufficient priuately to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse all their sinnes, and to do penance ether priuately or publickely, as the preist should thinke most conuenient and for his good, this is manifest by Origen Hom. 2. in psal. 37.</p>

                     <p>In this age there was practise in the church of God, both of a penitentiarie preist, as also priuate and publick penances enioyned by the preist vnto sinners and notoriouse delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. A publick penance was then enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when the sinne committed was publick, and so satisfaction to be donne publickely for it, in, and before the face of the church. Priuate penance was then ordained, when for the sinne declared secretly to the preist by confession, he had penance enioyned to be donne secretelie.</p>
                     <p>And albeit by reason of these publick pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, a custome might (in the heare of Christians deuotions as in Campania after their did) growe, that there the bishops did allowe, that the penitents for euery secret sinne confessed, should doe publick penance, and haue their sinnes recited publickly, <hi>per modum libelli,</hi> for their greater confusion and satisfactiō, yet this maner was reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:181278:91"/> by S. Leo as after shalbe declared, and order sett downe, that secrett sinnes should onely (accordinge to the nature of secrecy) be confessed sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The accustomed maner to do solemne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penance was this, which was enioyned for some great and heynouse sinne. First in the beginninge of Lent, the bishop and preist with the penitent, meets at the doore of the cathedral church barefooted, his head shorne, with demisse looke, and so sayinge the seauen penitentiall psalmes, the bishope layes his hand vpon the penitent, sprinkels him with holy water, layes ashes vpon his head, and puts on a hayrcloth, &amp; so declares vnto him, that as Adam was cast out of paradise, so he is cast out of the church, and thus the bishop bids the clergye to driue the penitēts foorth, recyting this verse: <hi>

Soe we read, that in the councell of Ancyrane, there
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:181278:92"/> were some times three years penance enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now for these publick penitents, there was appointed a distinct habite, a seperate place, an appointed time, and soundry pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. Their habite was of a duskish couler with heircloth, their head pouled and shorne (wemen excepted who went veiled) and this custome was in Tertullians time li. de poenit. anno 200. In the age of Pacian anno 393. as appeareth in his parenisy to penance. In the time of Optatus 370. In the time of S. Ambrose ad virg. lap. c. 8. 380. and when the councel of Agatha was held in the yeare 439. where is both mention made of habite and shearinge of haire. The place to do this penance in was diuerse, for S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Neocaesariensis in his canonicall epistle mentioneth fiue. The first in the lower part of the church furthest from the alter without the church doore, and had his name by their weepinge lamenting and prayer. The second within the church, a place of hearing praier, but not admitted to praier. The third within both to heare and communicate &amp; in praier, yet not to come to masse, a place onely to pray and contemplate. The fourth to come neere the alter and to the sacrifice, yet not to communicate at the alter where they stoode. The fift a place of expectation to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when they had fulfilled their penance. The time for enioyninge solemne penance

                     <p>Moreouer as Thomas Waldensis noteth, and it is recorded in the tripartite history li. 6. c. 1. that Iulian the Apostata, framminge fitt occasion to the vtter ouerthrowe of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vtterly abandoned confession, <hi>studebat abrenunciare confessioni:</hi> Which argueth the practise in like sorte of the time, and malice which the wickeder sorte of Christians haue alwaies had against confession.</p>
                     <p>By S. Gregory Nissene appeareth that it was vsuall about Easter euery yeare to make their confessions, and so continually in practise euen till this age, and which after by negligence was omitted, by positiue lawe was commanded. Neither was the practise of the church in these daies for preists onely to preach forgiuenesse of sinnes, and that the ministery of preists consisted onely in this, to denounce pardon of sinne by Christ, but that by them sinnes were pardoned: For the Nouatian heretickes denied not,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:181278:99"/> but preists might preach forgiuenesse by Christ, but gaine saied the whole church, that preists had auctority to forgiue sinnes. for this cause and for noe other, S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose writeth against them, to prooue the manifest truth of preists absolution.</p>
                     <p>And wheras the 4. councell of Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge c. 78. anno Domini 398. mentioneth in the act of penance (Imposition of hands) albeit this ceremony was practised in most auncient churches, and now is vsuall to lay hands on the penitents head, yet this ceremony apperteineth not to the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of absolution: for it is said Iohn. 20. whose sinnes yee forgiue are forgiuen, and not vpon whom yee shall impose your handes. Therfore Saint Thomas opuscul. 22. de Sacra. absolut. accounteth it not an essentiall poynt. And further when the 4. councell of Carthage cap. 80. biddeth that euery fastinge day the penitents shall come to the church to the preists, and that he shall impose handes vpon them, and cap. 78. that after a daungerouse sicknesse (though by confession their sinnes be forgiuen) they must haue handes layed vpon them, this is onely vnderstood, of a ceremony of absoluinge from excommunication or such penalties, which ordinarily was donne by imposition of hands.</p>

                     <p>Albeit the imposition of hands (as before was declared) apperteineth not to the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Sacrament and forgiuenesse of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; yet if wee read the constitutions of S.

Albeit some were accustomed by good aduise and counsell of their ghostly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to whom they confessed all their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) to confesse publickely some one more greiuouse and notorious sinne, as is apparant by Origen Hom. 2. in psal. 37. Yet were they not bound to this, but as their zeale and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion should further them in it, for their greater sorrowe and confusion, by the mature aduise of their ghostly father. But after No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatus had once broached his heresy, it was thought expedient vnto the bishops, to add some what moreouer to the former canons, lest that the Nouatians might any way accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se the Catholickes, with touch of too much gentlenesse of reconcilinge and admittinge the lapsed to the holy Eucharist; And beinge that this penitentiary, should be elected emonge the rest, such a one as should be, <hi>secretorum tenax &amp; taciturnus,</hi> close and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, this was not much expedient for their publick sinnes: yet bicause in comminge to this preist, they not onely declared their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick crimes, but withall their most inward sinnes, therfore in this respect secrecy was required. Neither was this penitentiary preist sole and onely allotted to heare euery ones confession, but for publick delinquents. For so relateth Zosomenus who (after he had declared the institution of this penitentiary
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:181278:103"/> preist by the bishops in Nouatus time, and after at Constantinople by Nectarius abroga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, and the vse therof diligently obserued at Rome, and soe continued as in other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the west, though putt downe at Constantinople) he saieth notwithstanding in his owne time (which was about the yeare 430.) this constitution appertained onely to publick penitents▪ for if it had bene for all delinquents, how could one haue suffised for so many thousands. Now that the bishops that adioyned this appendix to the canons, ment not in any wise, that secret sinnes should bee assubiected to publick confession, bicause both Zozomenus and Nicephorus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that that custome of confessinge to the penitentiarie preist (abrogated by Nectarius) was vsuall in Rome and other west churches. And as for S. Leo he auerreth (who was in Zozomenus time) that it was neuer accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Rome to confesse secret sinnes public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kly. For he himselfe epist. 80 chideth the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of Campania, for an indiscreet zeale in sufferinge the penitents to confesse all their sinnes publickly, which order he saieth, is improbable and against the aposteles rule; And moreouer if in the time of the peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary preist, all secret sinnes should haue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly bene declared and confessed, to what end should taciturnity, secrecy and hidinge of the penitents sinne in the penitentiary preist
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:181278:104"/> preist bene required? soe that to reueale se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret sinnes heard in confession, beinge against the lawe of nature (as all deuines affirme) against the apostolicall order (as S Leo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) if the institution of those bishops had commaunded this, then had it bene donne very well of Nectarius to haue abolished it.

For S. Cirill (whose doctrine is plaine for auricular confession) and Celestine (most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in penance for concubinary preists which had comitted any act with their ghostly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that came to confession to them) giue sufficient proofe for it in the whole church, and noe doubt, if any difficultie or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy had bene herein, S.

And by like reason we may thinke, that the same doctrine was brought into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Irland, and Scotland: for that good pope Celestine, ordained Palladius and made
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:181278:113"/> him bishope and sent him into these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, namely Scotland, a Grecian borne, and so conuerted them by his sweet conuersation and holy doctrine to the folde of Christ. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whom in like manner the same Celestine sent S.

Sythe God by Moyses in the ould lawe appoynted not onely oxen, goats, and rammes for sacrifice which the riche might well performe, but moreouer so condescended, that he came to the acceptance of the turtle and the pigion, yea of meale to make a sacrifice, soe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:181278:115"/> respectiue he was to the poore and weaker sorte. So that whether we regard more the opinion of Caricles, or of Nilus, we see by both, that then the custome was to confesse their sinnes, and accordinge to the abylitie of their body to haue an enioyned penance.</p>
                     <p>As before we presumed that by Celestine (who sent Palladius and Patricius) confession and the discipline of penance was brought in to these northren Ilands: so againe now by Gregory the great, who sent Saint Augustine into England, may bee supposed, that our Englishemen receyuinge the rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Romaine church, that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which was generally vsed in al Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, should not here be omitted and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected but truly and throughly taught, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is noe doubt to be made. For after Saint Augustine came into England, and was consecrated by Etherius bishop of Arles, Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sinnes vnto a preist was euer after practised. For the Saxons neuer made any knight of the feild, but thy went to some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouse house or other, where with a whole nyghts watchinge and prayinge after confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their sinnes to a preist, and receiuinge of the holy Sacrament, they were doubbed knights. And forasmuch as now the heresie of the Iacobites was a broatchinge, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession onely to be made to God and to noe man, if eyther Augustine or Etherius had
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:181278:116"/> bene thus protestantlyke affected, Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory beinge soe seuere for confession, would neyther haue had Etherius consecrated Saint Augustine, nor Saint Augustine to haue bene the Apostle of our countrye. In the councell of Antioche vnder Iulius the first, thus much is apparant for confession can 2. That such as had made a diuision from the church of God, for some proper or peculiar doctrine of their owne, were to be abandoned and auoided, vntill by confession they shewed and gaue testimonie of fruicts worthye of penance.</p>

                     <p>In this age both Charles the great, as also Lewes the first, were most vigilant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue the church discipline truly and sincerely obserued. In so much that Lewes (for his sanctitie and holinesse of life called, <hi>pius,</hi> as affirmeth Amonius an auncient hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striographer) was so watchefull and carefull of his life and conuersation, for the better amendement of his life, and edification of his neighbour; when he was sick, in all the time of his sicknesse he vsed to confesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with due and diligent examine of his conscience, which godly Emperor was longe before the councell of Latterane. Wherby it is euident, that confession was vsed before, and not then as a nouelty brought in by tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se good fathers; And moreouer it appeareth, that auricular confession to a preist, was not abrogated by Nectarius, sith it was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Empire, and practised as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commaunde of Christe.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore in a councel holden at Aquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graine anno 816. wherat Charles the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was present, it was most piously decreed, that euery captaine in warre might haue a preist with him to heare confessions, and to be iudge of their sinnes, and consequently
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:181278:123"/> to enioyne them penance. Which decree hath bene since continually kept, and is at this day verie religiouslie obserued by the Catholick Kinge of Spayne, who alloweth for euerie band of souldiours, one preist to heare confessions. In soe much, that in a councel at Cabilon, about the same tyme of Charles the great, there is a plaine confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of auricular confession, and, that confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was vsed in those dayes both to God and man, that is to his ghostlie father a preist. And bicause diuerse Christians, partly for ignorance or negligence or smale regard they had of their soules, went not ordinarylie to confession, with a full examine and diligent scrutiny of their consciences vnto the preist, declaring all their sinnes committed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie and inwardly, this holie councell or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned a canon for due reformation therof: Where wee may note not onely in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but in the councell of Turinge in lyke sort, that the custome of enioyninge fasts and abstinence to penitents, was duely obserued after a prescript order after confession. And bicause diuerse preists behaued themselues oftentimes indiscreetlie in this their iudiciary power and auctority committed to iudge, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, and enioyne penances; therfore by the assembly of bishops it was determined, what penitentiall booke for this end was most cheefly to be followed by the preist. And
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:181278:124"/> such was the strictnesse that in the councell of Cabilon 35. canon both abstinence from fleshe &amp; wine was enioyned to delinquents after confession.

O Lorde to whom noe secrett is hyd, I humbly beseech thee, that if there be any sinne in me, which as yet I haue not confessed, I may cale it to mynd and truly, and throughly confesse it vnto my Abbot whilest he is heer yet present, that so I may be absolued of him, who hath full auctority and power ouer me. Hauinge this sayd, a voyce was heard: Truly truly there is yet somethinge behynd, which thou haste not confessed. The ould sick man hearinge the voyce, and not knowinge from whence it came, prayed further and sayd. O Lord tell me what it is, that I may confesse it: at which request the voyce tould what it was, and soe he humbly confessinge it to the Abbot, was absolued.

Aeneas Siluius de orig. Bohem c. 53. They were called Waldenses, of one Waldo a marchant of Lyons, who beinge rytch but vtterly vnlearned, so as he could neyther
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:181278:129"/> write nor read, yet instituted this order vnder profession to liue in greater pouerty then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did. To reuenge themselues of the pope (who would not allowe their sect) they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised certaine articles, wherof one was, that they reiected the auctority decrees, canons, iurisdiction and indulgences of the bishope of Rome: they denyed all sacramentall confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, purgatory, inuocatiō of Sainctes, prayer for the deade, holy dayes &amp; ordinary fastinges appoynted by the church. They called in question three sacraments, to witt Auricular confession, confirmation, and extreme vnc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Concerninge which heresie wee may note. 1. That the practise of the whole church of Fraunce, was to haue secret confession, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which these out of their malice did spurne at, to liue more freely without any redresse or amendment of their sinnes. 2. They agreed with the Catholickes against the protestants in many articles, and therfore our protestants can not hould them for sound deuines of their side, for they held the masse and consecration of Christs, most sacred body. 3 They disagreed both from protestants and papists in many other articles, as that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie of consecratinge and makinge the body of Christ in the masse, was gyuen also vnto Laymen, if they were iust and in gods fauour. They affirmed that all preists ought to be poore, thē belyke preists were not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed,

                     <p>After that this was broached, and this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety instituted, these men requested to haue their order confirmed, and priuiledged by the sea apostolick, as recordeth Abbas Vrs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergensis in chronicon anno 1212. who also did see some of that nomber at Rome. But the pope seinge certaine suspiciouse things in their conuersation, as to goe in longe haire, like lay men, to carry wemen about with them in their company, who kept with them at bedd and at woorde; they were discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and reiected by pope Innocent the third. Wherupon presently they began to deuise means to reuenge them selues, by calling the popes auctority into question. In soe much that if the sea apostolick should haue admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their sect and abuses, they would not haue spurned soe eargely against that church, but would haue admitted their doctrine: for as their stomackes did rise, soe their malice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and euery yeare denied some one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or other that the church of Rome did hould.

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus archebishope of Florence, writinge the begininge of these poore men, bouldly pronounceth, that it was from certaine mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of darkenesse. Trithemius in his chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle vpon the yeare 1160. writeth of it as a most perniciouse heresy. And Paulus Aeme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lius in his story of Fraunce, relateth that at this time two religiouse orders were abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the pope, the one caled themselues Humiliates, the other the poore men of Liōs vagrant persons, leadinge wemen of their owne sect with them: as for Innocent the third (vnder whom was the counsel of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane) he vtterly condemned their opinion, ordaininge with the councel, that euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of lawfull age, should confesse vnto their perishe preist at Easter. And to showe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the practise of the church was then generally contrary to their sect, first for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland we read, that Hubert Archbishop of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:181278:130"/> Canterbury, about this time, decreed that euery preist should (when he heard confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) consider euery circumstance, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the persons, the quantity of the fault, and so accordingly enioyne penance. Also the second councell of Latherane vnder Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the third, aduertiseth concerninge mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of penance, that the quality and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the sinne, the age of the offender, his witt, reason, and condicion, are greatly to be respected in penance. For saieth he, a mans endeuour noe lesse is to be punished, then the effect: and moreouer to a secret fault a secret penance is to be enioyned, and that noe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe preist which is not the penitents iudge, can either bind or loose.

That Auricular cōfessiō was first instituted, and as it were by a positiue lawe brought in by pontificall auctority and mans ordinance, without any further appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of gods woord. And albeit say they (as witnesseth Caluine lib. 3. instit, c. 4.8.7.) that confession may well claime prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time out of mind, beinge a most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custome, yet without any seruility, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage or enforcement of lawe therunto, left to the full currant of mans liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.

                     <p>But by that which wee haue related out of former times, this surmise is easily refuted: for it is most apparant against Caluine and his companions, that this prescript time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession at Easter, albeit it was here by Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent instituted, and then as a lawe made and promulged; yet was it not the first, as though neuer before any lawe ordinance or prouiso had therfore bene ether constitute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

For it is cleere by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the church in S Ciprians time anno. 248. and by S. Leo in his epistles to Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore bishope and his 91. epistle, where he saieth, that our Sauiour Iesus gaue this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the rectors and rulers of his church, to enioyne penance to such as confessed, and after satisfaction made and clensed, to admitt them to the holy communion of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist by the doore of reconciliation. Where wee may see both lawes, ordinances, institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, power, and auctority both by Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and his ministers ordained, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the great benefit of reconciliation by confession. The reason then why the holy councell of Latherane ordained such a lawe that once a yeare euery parishioner at least should repaire vnto his parishe preist and goe to confession was, forasmuch as where sinne
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:181278:134"/> is mother, shame is the daughter, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the frequentinge of the Sacrament may seeme to very many burdensome and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouse, that once the reines of liberty lett loose, the vulgare, yea the nicer sorte in this remedy for their soules health, takes such a desperate deafenesse, that with all delaies they care not whether euer or neuer they heare of it. Wherfore as that good pope Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherine anno 198. sett downe this ordinance, and commaunded that all should receiue at Easter, not so as though they had not bene tied and bounde before therunto, for euen by the lawe of Christ it was promulged, that except they did eate his fleshe and drink his blood, they could not haue life euerlastinge, but bicause his fatherly care and prouidence was such to remedy the lukewarmnesse and couldenesse of deuotion hereunto of many, prefixed a time of receauinge, beyonde which it should not be lawefull to deffer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatinge of the holy Sacrament. Soe in like sorte it was appointed, not as an absolute commaund of confession, for to this euery one ar commanded by Christ, but onely a determination of time when it should be donne, by limitation wherof the carelesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of many might be redressed, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waise would be negligēt enough of so whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a remedy, were not the ecclesiasticall censure a bitt vnto their liberty, that with an

For albeit in the yeare 1323. one Iohn de Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaco a deuine of Paris, diuulged certaine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors concerninge the hearinge of confession in the time of Lewis of Bauaria a german Emperor and Iohn 22. yet this doeth nothing preiudice the custome and vse then, but giue a full remonstrance of those times.

                     <p>As for reuealinge of confessions, it was carefully looked vnto and especiall regard hadd therof; for there were great penalties enioyned, as in the age of Gregory the great and after, that such should be degraded, as by bishope Gualter appeareth.

                     <head>The heresy of Wicliffe contrary to the practise of the church, and doctrine of the fathers.</head>
                     <p>About the yeare of Christ 1352. one Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse an Englisheman borne, master of art and preist in Canterbury colledge of Oxford, person of Lutherwoorth in Leicester shier, a man altogether turbulent and troublesome in all actions against the clergie, broached againe some errors, which were before dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sallowed, as namely 45. condemned in the councell of Constance, his 7. article was, that if a man bee truly contrite for his sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, externall confession is superfluouse and vnprofitable; As alsoe defendinge that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:181278:137"/> confession can not be proued out of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither hath it any grownd in scripture for the approbation therof.</p>
                     <p>For confutation of which heresy, wee may note 1. That this his errors proceeded more of stomake and pride, then of any zeale or conscience he had in religion, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge he consorted himselfe with the Duke of Lancaster, who was glad then to catch hould of any occasion against the clergie, as Stow noteth. 2. That it is noe marueil that euer confession (which is a true humiliation of the spirite) could haue anie entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or be approued in so proude a stomack, seinge it is the nature of all such that maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne such desperate resolutions, to fly from all true catholick deuotion. 3. That this was an opinion newly brought in againe to trouble the church, against the doctrine of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and practise of all Christendome, and an opinion before condemned and neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore countenanced as truth in England. 4. That it hath the note of heresy (to denie) for it denieth that, which for many hundred years was before mainteined as the doctrine of Christ in all Christendome, and therfore catholick confession hath the prerogatiue of time and place, and the other preeminence which is gotten by sayinge it is not soe. 5. Our prorestāts ar smally benefited hereby, for they mainteine but the nouelties of one in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:181278:137"/> whom stomake did striue with witt for will to gett the mastery. 6. If it had bene sound doctrin which Wickliffe taught of not going to confession; beinge so troblesome to fleshe and blood, the church would easily haue condescended, and not approued that which is so much against our nature, as the lawe of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer as these positions of Wickliffe were preiudiciall to the whole church of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland, so were they condemned by acts of parlament, as in the fift yeare of Richard the second 1280. as also anno 2. Henrici 3. 1402. by Cicheley vtterly suppressed as most impiouse doctrine, &amp; cōtrary to the woord of God. And albeit the protestants and some other of Zwitzerland agreed with him in some points, yet they held him (as Ioachimus Vadianus a Zinglian) for a pratler and scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing deuine, yea Pantaleon for an impudent heretick in his chronologie. His opinions were condemned by the generall councell of Constance, he was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and by Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge bishop of Lincolne: his bones were taken vpp and burned by command of Pope Martin the fift.</p>
                     <p>How many learned men of all sorts oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them selues against him in that age, is apparant; for not onely Thomas Waldensis who cōfuted his heresies, but diuerse others,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:181278:138"/> as William Barton Chancelor of Oxford con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Wickliffes, &amp; sett an enquest of 12. men vpon him, six of the begginge fryers and of other deuines and ciuill and cannon lawyers other six, who all vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his opinions anno 1382. And albeit Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Repington a frend of Wickliffes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine of Oxford, writ in defence of Wickliffe and especially against auricular confession, yet he vpon more mature aduise, recanted his opinions at Paules crosse. Thomas Bombe an other deuine &amp; Carmelite writ most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly against him, and as sayeth friar Bale against Wickliffes scholers, <hi>scorpionis venena intulit.</hi> Nicolas Hardford scholer of Wickliffe recanted his opinions as most absurd 1382. One Raukin, Iohn Sharp, Roger Walbey an Augustin friar, Richard Maidestone vnder Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard the second, Symon Sowthray, Peter Stokes, Thomas Winterton all learned and not inferior to Wickliffe for iudgement and sufficiency of learninge, writt most sowndly and iudicially against his opinions, but to proceed to the doctrine of the fathers.</p>

            <p>THus hast thou seene (courteouse reader) euen from Christs time, one and the selfe same doctrine of auricular confession, taught of the learnedst doctors, beleeued as the true and holy woord of Christ, practised in the vniuersall church, in full currant and continuance these 1600. yeares both in the greek and latine church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now then since that confession carries with it the countenance euen from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours owne auctority, the approbation of the holy Apostles, the doctrine of the most auncient fathers, the iustifiablenesse of the

            <p n="3">3. Since that it hath bene euer praise woorthy, full of pietie and vertue, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all true lowlinesse and humility of harte, the acquietinge of a troubled cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and the onely phisition for the inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate diseases and leprosie of the infected soule.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Since that the blames that are laid against it are either false or feeble, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of weaknesse which is commonly bould; or obiected by bouldnesse (a rashe and presumptuouse obtruder) or deuised by the vnskilfullest, the grownds of whose opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ar but the vncertainties of their owne ignorance, and as it were the triflinge blots and blurrs of their inke wastinge toyes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Since that the aduersarie him selfe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues it the prerogatiue of time, and can not denie it the prescription of great antiquitie, though he troubles him selfe in the dust of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:181278:143"/> his owne labours to giue it the preeminence of birthright but from the staines of humaine inuention. I beseeche thee then most gentle reader, as thou doest tender the truth of gods cause, and good of thine owne soule, that as mindfull of the tribunall and maiestie of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, before which one day thou shalt appeare as a dust-creepinge woorme as thou art, where all harts shalbe opened &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets disclosed: not to gainesay that truth which God shall manifest vnto thee, or for feare of prince or potentate to temporize some fewe yeares, thereby to dispossesse thy selfe of the fruition of all eternall blisse and happinesse. Lett not stomack soe maister thee as to haue all tounge &amp; noe eares; to speak all and hearken to nothinge, to crowe to much with the cocks, on this worlds dounghill.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If affectatiō of singularity hath ambushed it selfe within thy bosome, if thou hast pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they selfe to their sleeues, whom igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant zeale hath made violent in religion, as to tearme this seekinge into fathers writings to looke for truth, a rakinge into kennels and ditches, and to discharge most of them for rogues and men branded in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads (as Carttwright l. 1. pag. 114. that, good wheel-wright was wount in his owne shopp to hewe such grosse chipps) if thou wilt not beleeue so many learned men, as haue bene alledged, but think, that to be
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:181278:143"/> tied and led by auctority, is a certaine slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery and captiuity of iudgement. If thou wilt not beleeue with S. Augustine, l. 2. con.

If thou wilt not beleeue as did the Samaritans in a matter of farr greater moment, vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of one silly wooman, yet (courteouse reader) thus much beleeue, that antiquity &amp; the fathers auctority, hath euer bene euen emonge the heretickes themselues, the best stake in their hedge.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Did not Arius in the pedlarie of all his ware, grownd his truth vpon the auncient father Origen, and alleadged him tooth and naile for him selfe? And did not the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists build vpon S. Ciprian; The Nestorians vpon the councell of Nice; The Pelagians vaunte of S Ambrose, S. Hierome. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine? Did not Dioscorus alleadge Gregory, Cirill, Athanasius? and complained openly in the first councell of Calcedon, <hi>Ego</hi> (saieth he) <hi>defendo dogmata sanctorum patrum, ego illorum habeo testimonium, non obiter nec in transcursu, sed in ipsorum libris, &amp; ideo cum patribus eij cior.</hi> I defend the opinion of the holy fathers, I haue their testimony, not by any by, or sinister way, but in their owne bookes, and therfore I with the holy fathers am reiected. What an aufull respect (a bird of their owne father) Beza seemed to haue
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:181278:144"/> of the auncient fathers (albeit the Geneua shoe is altogether vnfit for their foote) in soe much that he thus writeth to some that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their nouelties in translatinge, and heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon cales them to remembrance of former times and (euen in the shadow of this name) chardgeth them with the most worthy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Nice, of Ephesus of Calcedon <hi>quo nihil vnquam Sanctius, nihil Augustius ab apostolorum decessu sol vnquam aspexit,</hi> then which since the apostles time, the sonne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beheld any thinge more holy more royall or famouse.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Soe then (Christian reader) this can not but seeme reason, and sinke euen into the shalowest witts; that if in matters of lesser moment, it was neuer thought safe and secure to neglect the iudgement of many (euen with the heretickes them selues) how much more in matters of greater waight shal it be accompted folly, rashely to followe the opinion of fewe, and desperatly beat against the harte of all true catholick doctrine, euen as it were striue against the maine streame of all?</p>
            <p n="9">9. And how can any vertuously disposed mind, better resolue with it selfe then thus (if he will but range within the Zodiacke of a Christian mans witt) to think what the holy auncient fathers haue written (I know there is nothinge but that an itchinge tounge
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:181278:144"/> may rubb it selfe vpon) and that which they haue written they haue not diuulged it, as particular in opinion or wedded to partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or hungry of their owne praise, either to grieue protestant, or gratifie papist, but euen as trueth in those ages ledd them by the handes, <hi>Quod inuenerunt in ecclesia tenue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, quod didicerunt, docuerunt; quod a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus acceperunt, hoc filijs tradiderunt.</hi> What they found in the church, that they kept, what they had learned that they taught, what they heard and receiued from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they deliuered to their posteritie.</p>

And shall wee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that darkenesse hath soe ouergrown the land (as S. Augustine obiected to Iulian. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. cont.

            <p n="11">
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:181278:145"/>11. What were there noe learned men before these youngsters taught their A, B, C, the principles of the Geneua doctrine? Was wisdome euer so in ebbe, that it could neuer haue its flowe till the springe-tide of these our wanton yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es? Did ignorance and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denesse keepe faire at euery mans gate, and was there such publick sale therof, that there could be noe true knowledge in these times bought for monie? Was Tertullian, Origen, Ciprian, Cirill, Athanasius, Ambrose, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome and Augustine, able to diue into the depthe of other misteries of our saluation, that euen in the cheefest matters of faith their woords were accompted as oracles of truth, and in this point of confession and preists absolution from sinnes, shall their opinion be accompted as arrowes idlie shott at randome? And now soe shallowe witted and their witts soe light, as to want both waight and measure?</p>
            <p n="12">12. Or shall wee beleeue these rather, whome some of the protestants and namely Couell call (as fittinge most to such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors) turbulent heads, whom affectation of singularity hath raised vpp their plumes; whom superstitiouse feare, ignorant zeale (not directed with discretion) hath made violent in matters of religion, that ouerrun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge euery text of scripture (as much as in them lieth) haue dismēbred the very limmes
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:181278:145"/> of truth? Shall soe smale vndigested and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe learninge, be in ballance able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the world and the very touchstones of all witts? Was the bible neuer sought into, neuer vnderstood, Christes meanninge for preists absolution neuer conceiued till now? And that these had onely hitt the needell iust in the eye? What was it euer dawninge of the day, and for soe many hundred years, soe many gloumish morninges, till this their faire sun-shime had crept to the high prick of their noone, soe that we must be enforced to sett all our dialls by their clockes?</p>
            <p n="13">13. Then (Christian reader) iudge as the very truth is, that the antiquity of the fathers is most sound and of great waight, and that such as maliciously should neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, do most greeuously offend the holy ghost, <hi>in illis praesidentem &amp; loquentem,</hi> and in whose writinges, <hi>viuit &amp; loquitur continenter,</hi> and hereby enlighteneth the whole church of God, both for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of darkest misteries, as also for the confirmation and propagation of the true auncient and catholick faith. For; for what other reason may wee suppose, that after the apostles, prophets, and euangelists, by deuine institution, and blessednesse of gods hande, haue bene appointed in all ages and places pastors and doctors, but that as S. Paule saieth (Ephes. 4.11.) to this end, that is, to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:181278:146"/> the consumation of the saints vnto the woork of the ministery, vnto the edifyinge of the body of Christ, that wee may not be as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren waueringe and carried aboute with euery winde of doctrine in the wickednesse of men, in craftinesse to the circumuention of error.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Wherfore where all the holy doctors conspire and agree in any one point of our religion, it can not be but the sowndnesse of truth; In so much that if thus consentinge they should haue erred, it must consequently followe, the whole church of God (which is the basis and foundation of religion) to haue bene notoriously deceiued. <hi>Aberrante sequidem pastore necessarium est &amp; oues aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare &amp; quo oculi dirigunt corpus eo pariter re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liqua membra deferri mouerique necesse est.</hi> Whē the shepheard goeth a stray, the sheepe must needs roue and wander, and where the eyes lead, the body foloweth,</p>
            <p n="15">15. If then in this one pointe of Auricular confession, the agreement of soe many holy fathers, the practise of soe many ages, the accord of so many pastors in euery nation should haue bene palpable grosse ignorance and error; How should God haue bene agreeinge to his owne woord? What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife shall we giue to gods owne promises of the perpetuall assistance of the holy ghost, for the full establishement of all trueth and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:181278:146"/> doctrine? How can wee but accompt the wisdome of God meere folly, who hath built his house vpon sand, and not vpon sure grownd, to wagg with euery wind, and be ouerthrown with euery blast? <hi>Sed Deus nec fallit, nec fallitur.</hi> (lib 1. co. pelag. cap. 1.) Therfore against all busy inuouators tis best to conclude with S. Augustine, that it is meet that all Christian people, should rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the auncient fathers before any nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and stick fast rather to their iudgement, then to runne after euerie fancie, humorouse and giddy headed leader.</p>

            <p>AS hitherto hath bene manifested the the vniforme consent of the learnedest deuines, generall councels, and continuall practise of gods church for auricular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that herein hath bene euidently seen, that the daughter churches euery where did speake their mothers dialect: So it will not

            <p n="2">2. As in common wealthes most true it is, the ouerplus of rulers argueth superabon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of disorders, the multitude of phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians pesteringe of diseases, many lawyers great suites and causes, many iudges contrary opinions, which makes suites immortal, as where there is great resorte of eagles, there is great mortality and many carcases. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it fareth in causes and controuersies of religion; Where there be many opinions, there are most vnsettled minds, deuided minds makes vnioyned speeches, in so much that where controuersies in highest points doe most rise, religion is most vnsettled, and where there is banding too and fro, trueth now and then is driuen out of dores. For men standing in those moodes, stretching religion to euery mans tentor, as men oftimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett all mind of reconciliation, haue all their thoughts stained with the ouerflowe of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gale and choler, they resolue more (loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

For it is an oulde plague in mans nature, that many of the most parte of men, care not to post ouer trueth and leaue it farr behind, so they may sett on the spurrs of their fame and honor far before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence hath proceeded the harte-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of many the <hi>tot quot</hi> and pluralities of opinions, the whettinge of witts to the sharpe of their owne will, the bandinge and takinge parts one against another, that euery day they are brought to bedd of newe borne sects, through their violency of spirits, the turbulency of witts, the stiffneckednesse of opinions, the selfe pleasinge of will, the eagernesse of defence, the glidingnesse of their tounge, and the rancor of their harts; Which so inuenometh their penne, to spred abroad their poisen in all their writings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wherupon noe marueile it is, that our protestants religion is all ouerunne with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties of sects, the variety wherof, albeit Themistius the philosopher (as recordeth Socrates) perswaded Valens to entertaine as a seruice most pleasing to Gost, seinge by this meanes, he was worshipped after diuerse waies and soundry manners: Yet in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it must followe, that these our nouellants

Dauid the holy prophet, would aske of God but one spirite, and that a right, consideringe that it is the diuell which powereth many spirits into one body, many minds into one head, many opinions into one braine, and fraughts them euery day with newborne nouelties; Where God hath but for one body, one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to guid it, and in his church but one spirit to gouerne it, sith deuided spirits ar the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of confusion, where the singlenesse of spirit, is the mother of true religion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Then (deare soule) touchinge the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of auricular confession and preists ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, canst thou acertaine thy selfe, and by their restlesse opinions (as I will set thee downe the viewe hereafter) find any resting place for trueth? Maist not thou as well tie
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:181278:149"/> thy beleife, to the laste of Luthers foote, as to any word of Caluines mourh. Yea I see noe reason, sith thou doest most grownd vpon that notable foundation <hi>(hearsay)</hi> and will haue noe more beleife then thou seest through the thick spectacles of selfe lykinge, why thou maiest not as well lend thy beleefe to Illiricus, Selnecerus sworne Lutherans to penance and confession, as to the same Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus and Selnecerus abiuringe and becoming in few years new reformed Sacramentaries? Or to Caluine, to day thus disposed, or to morrowe otherwise aduised? Canst thou looke for of vnsettled minds a settled resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō, or of staggeringe or euer-startinge heads any sure footinge, or steaddy pace, or of vngrownded principles any sure or sownd religion? Then thou maist well suppose that it is not the protestants doctrine, towching the trueth of preists forgeeuinge sinnes, that can assure thy beleefe, noe more then with a disordered haile-shott, to hitt the marke. For as all bodies, where there is most disturbance of humors, are soonest subiect to dissolution; Soe in all matters of religion, where there is such bandinge in opinions, and where they neither goe with the feet, not resolue with the head, these must needes be farthest off from all true resolution: for labouringe onely with the witt, to peirce farther and farther, they runne vpon endlesse rockes, and winde

To the ryotouse and dissolute, it goes against his hayre to doe penance with hayrecloth and ashes. To the wanton and lasciuiouse, it is not for their humor to fast and pray.

And to come to the nycest dames for confession,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:181278:158"/> they ar too coye, and tiptoe wise to kneele downe at a preists feet, and tell their sinnes for absolution. In soe much that all hereticks and Atheists, ar soe high stoomackt &amp; strayt laced, that there is not amonge a thowsand one, but thinkes his witt best, and noe coyne good, but that which is stampt with his owne marke.</p>
            <p>Beinge therfore that scripture is the booke of lyfe, and yet enclosed within the shell of crabbed difficulties, and that the anuyle wherupon it is to be hammered, is not within the forge of euery brainsicke head.

            <p>And to follow the rule which Aristotle (the very toutchstone of witt) hath expresly sett downe to knowe vnto whome most cheefly wee ar to lend our beleefe▪ he redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it principally to this, that for three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

If he be our frend and a frendlie man. For it carryes with it great probability of reason, that a wise man should hardly erre, a good and godly man should seldome lye, and a frendly man not often deale doubly with his frends.</p>
            <p>Of all these three two especially haue bene most apparant in all the eclesiasticall doctors, which haue wittnessed the trueth of our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, and haue withstood the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligninge spirite of all gainesayinge and vpstart heretickes. For in the deepest and soundest points of all philosophy, both morall, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale and supernaturall haue not most of them had such a prerogatiue of excellency, that those were counted the perfectest deuines, which were skillfullest in their writinges?

            <p>SIthence that all scripture is of God, and therfore hath such force and efficacy, that all proofe which is taken from thence, must needs be of all other most inuincible, beinge the starr which leads vs to Christ, the ladder which mounts vs vpp to heauen, the verie toutchstone to try all trueth by; Hence it hath proceeded, that mens affections haue more growndedly framed their opinions; and in defence of any conceited truth hereby, haue bene more earnest a great deale in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance therof, according as the nature of that euidence which scripture yealdeth, hath wrought correspondētly in their beleife. And albeit in citinge scripture, such may be, from text to text the vndeniable verity alleadged and reasons soe apparantly propounded, that the scripture proofe noe doubt in vallieu and strength exceedeth al: Yet how many ar there now a daies that, for the most parte, euen such as are readiest to cite for one thinge fiue
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:181278:163"/> hundred sentences of holy scripture, will cutt the thrid and quote the text soe right, that it shall iustly auoutch the selfe same thinge, for which it is brought and therunto alleadged. Did not Ireneus writinge against the heretick Valentinus then vpbraide the Nouellants of that age, with this itching humor, of mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge and misconstruinge the holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?

            <p>I will not defraude thee (gentill reader) of such maine sinewes from which more powerfull incitements in perswasion may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise both Pro and Con, in the quotation of scripture texts, neither would I haue thee to thinke euery cited place of anie one, a sure inducement to make saleable any cause in grosse, nature woorkinge in vs all, a loue to like our owne conceits. Howbeit that scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:181278:164"/> being alleadged plentifully on both sides (with an ouerchardge sometimes) lest the holy verity of the cause should any way be vnwittnessed, yet I earnestly desire thee to reexamine euery text, parcell by parcell, to to sift and resolue all alleadged proofes of scripture, and so shalt thou come to the very roote from whence trueth doeth springe, and to the triall of that toutchstone, wherin all resolution of mans mind relieth. It shalbe neither (thine) nor (mine) (my yea) nor (thy nay) sith euerie breath may well blow to it selfe some probable coniecture of their owne. For in that strife which was between the catholicke fathers and the Arians, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists and others of such like peruerse and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward disposition, as longe as one alleadged scripture on the one side, scripture on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

            <p>I haue here therfore most plainely sett downe what by scripture can apparantly be obiected, and soe with all as euidently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed how with scripture it may be solued, soe that the verity of the scripture (which ar wittnesses proper to neither but common to vs both) I haue left as indifferent to be

            <p>SVch was the loue and fauoure of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple towards Pericles in Athens, and vnto Cirus in Persia, that the midwiues and nurses in both these countries, had chardge giuen them by parents, to shewe their best skill to frame and mould their younge infants like vnto Cirus in Persia, and Pericles, in Athens. Yet fewe or none (though the nurses did their best endeuours (were found in Athens like Pericles, vnlesse it were with a longe head, and fewe or none were heard of in Persia like Cirus, vnlesse it were with a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nose. Perusinge ouer (gētil reader) the late somme of conference before the kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie concerninge the pointe of preists abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, with the assembly of Ministers, the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:181278:174"/> midwiues and nurses of that religion, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to frame and mould it accordinge to the institution of Christe, I find littell or none accorde at all with the doctrine of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or practise of the church, euen from the Apostles time, with this their newe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented manner of absolution, or like in any point to that vsed in those former ages, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a certaine shewe of retaininge the name of confession and absolution, which wee may ether tourne to a shipmans hose, or a crooked persian nose of wax.</p>
            <p>For if we consider the confession and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution specified in the conference pag. 8. there are two kinds onely expressed as from God; the one generale, the other particular, the first littell differenced from praier or preachinge (which doe importe noe absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the second more speciall, and to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to speciall parties, who hauinge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a scandale and repentinge, are absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for otherwise where neither excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication nor penance precedeth, there needes noe absolution. As alsoe pag. 12. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession there expressed to be in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of the communion book, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution followinge it, wherin the Minister doeth nothinge els but pronounce an absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in generale. And moreouer, view but in the communion booke the other, more particuler and personale forme of absolution
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:181278:175"/> prescribed to be vsed in the order of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the sick, which the protestants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, &amp; not onely Augusta, Bohemia, Saxony, retaine and allowe, but master Caluine doeth alsoe approue, and is in England al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as apostolicale and a godly ordinance, in that this absolution is giuen in the name of Christe to one that desireth it, and vpon the cleeringe of his conscience.</p>
            <p>The order is in the visitation of the sick, that the sick person shal make a special confession. After which confession the Minister shall absolue him in this sorte. Our Lord Iesus Christe who hath left power to his church to absolue all sinners &amp;c. and by his auctority committed to me, I absolue thee from all thy sinnes, in the name of the father and of the sonne and of the holy ghost. This maner of absolution and confession is seen &amp; allowed as apostolicall by the protestants, and wee are to examine how farr foorth it accordeth with the practise of the former ages, euer since the Apostles and Christes time.</p>

               </gap>ed out of the 8. page, where there is acknowledged but two sorts of absolution, the one generale by praier and preachinge, the other absolution from scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and as wee tearme them, suspensions and censures of the church, And yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse in the 13. page, there is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledgement
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:181278:175"/> of an other maner of absolution from sinnes after a particuler and speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, with an absolution from those speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied sinnes, which made the bishope of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to stepp a littell more forward, and to deale more plainely, that besides the former absolutions, there was yet a more particuler and personale forme prescribed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion booke, to be vsed in the order of the visitation of the sick, which his Maiestie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not.</p>
            <p>Nowe then to see but howe these our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries do tread the same footestepps of their forefathers, &amp; in the shade of this name (Apostolicale) buyld vpp the fabrick of the reformed absolution: Lett vs demuande whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they yeald thus much vnto vs, that this confession and absolution of theirs (which they accompte as apostolicall) bee in such sorte &amp; maner as the catholicks tearme auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confession, with the ful enumeration of sinnes by the delinquent in confession, with all prostration and humilitie to his ghostly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with an acceptance to doe freely any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned penance, to curbe and chastice his bodye, and with a cleer forgiuenesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the sinnes by the power and aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the preist: which if they graunte, then is our musick sett to one keye, deuided minds well accorded, and the controuersy quickly ended,</p>

            <p>Hence is it that Origen in 2. ad Roman. caleth such, <hi>scripturarum fures &amp; adulteros,</hi> theues and adulterers of the scripture: and S. Ciprian caleth such interpreters, corrupters of the ghospell, artificers and craftes masters in corruptinge the trueth: Cip. de vnitate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae nu. 7. As on the other side for speciall reuerence and sincerity of dealinge in these matters, the holy fathers catholick preachers and learned expositors were of ould caled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to S. Paules woords 2. ad Timoth. c. 2. <hi>Recte tractantes verbum Dei,</hi> right hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the woord of God, and as it were squaringe it by a right liue and leuell. But if wee well consider our Englishe protestants dealing concerninge their reformations of religion, and squaringe the woord of God therunto, wee shall see them excell farr the auncient hereticks, none euer more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely handlinge the woord of God then they
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:181278:180"/> doe, especially in their englishe translations, euery one more and more seekinge for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties and innouations.</p>
            <p>It pleased the kings most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, in that conference, which he had with the Lords bishops, and other of the clergy, wherat the most of the Lords of the counsell were present anno 1603. Ian. 14. soe to giue his censure of our englishe translations, as he openly professed, that he could neuer yet see a bible well translated in englishe, but the woorst of all his Maiestie, thought the Geneua to bee, hauinge in them some notes very partiall, vntrue, seditiouse, and sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe too much of daungerouse and traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse conceites. Most true, it is for sithence the ghospell (as they call it) began in our country, wee haue hadd three kinds of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse bibles, vnder kinge Henry, kinge Edward, and Queen Elisabeth. Kinge Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries bibles as corrupt, were corrected by king Edward &amp; the duke of Somersetts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as noteth doctor Humfrey de ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione interpretandi l. 3. p. 323.</p>
            <p>Nowe that those translations vsed in the late Queens raigne were corrupt, besids his Maiesties censure, euen the ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues confesse, and are att variance for the truthe thereof D. Reynolds affirmeth that both Henry the eyghts, and Edward the sixts were corrupt and not answerable to the truth
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:181278:180"/> of the originale. The puritans doe demaund, whether with safe cooscience a man may subscribe to the communion booke, that it conteyneth nothinge contrarie to scriptures; seinge the translation of the psalmes differ from the trueth of the Hebrewe in 200. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or moe. Sutclif in his answer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie faction: findeth as great fault with the Geneua bible, which the puritants vse and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together embrace, and haue noe other diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie then it, which bible he sayeth, hathe many more grosse errors, then the translated psalmes. And thus wee see both communion booke and bible, are in question for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie and truthe. Hill pag. 54. of Christes descent into hell noe lesse misproueth one translation for false, that if a boy should but turne the greek soe into English, as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans haue donne; he thinkes he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue whippinge. And as for bishop Bilson he reproueth (in his preface to perpetuail go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement) the strayning of the text concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the greeke woord <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The text in the Englishe translation is not corrupt, but to be sure, that none should thinke here is mention made of catholick confession, they corrupt the text by their false and wicked marginale notes, and by vaine glosses and interpretations. For to the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:181278:182"/> first Math. 3. they note in the margent (letter h) Confessinge, that is acknowledginge that they were saued, onely by free remission and forgiuenesse of their sinnes. To the 2. they note alsoe, that they confessed their errors (leter h) and detested them openly, beinge terrified with the feare of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. And what is this to eare-strift, say they?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>That the marginall notes are false.</head>
               <p>First howe agrees this. Confessinge their sinnes, sayeth the text, that is as the note sayeth, they acknowledge that they were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. As if Iosue saying to Achan, make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and shewe me what thou hast donne, is as much as he should acknowledge that he was saued. Which neyther he, nor Iosue could tell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How could they acknowledge that they were saued by free remission of their sinnes, when as yet they knewe not the Messias, and Christe had not shedd his blood for the redemption of mankind?</p>
               <p n="3">3. S. Iohn Luc. 3. playes the good ghostly father: for when the multitudes came, as also the publicans and Soldiours to S. Ihon to be baptised, they alsoe noe doubt (as Math. 3. Marc. 1.) confessed their sinnes. And S. Ihon after confession, gaue them ghostlie counsel: as to the multitudes he sayd, he that hathe two coates, lett him giue to him that hathe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:181278:182"/> not. To the publicanes he sayd, doe nothinge more then is appointed you; to the souldiours he sayd, vex not neyther calumniate any mā, and be content with your stipends. Here S. Ihon counceleth them to giue almesse for their sinnes, to be obediēt to their superiors, to take heed of iniuringe anie. Nowe if Saint Ihon hadd beene a protestant, when these companies asked him what they should doe, he should haue sayd, beleue only &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your sinnes ar freely forgiuen, and that is enough: for to amend your liues, and to doe workes worthy of penance, is playne papistrye.</p>
